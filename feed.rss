<p><span data-contrast="auto">Lifeboost</span><span data-contrast="auto"> Coffee has a complete list of </span><span data-contrast="auto">FAQ</span><span data-contrast="auto"> in their website which you can access <a href="https://lifeboostcoffee.com/pages/faqs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">But, I’m </span><span data-contrast="auto">gonna</span><span data-contrast="auto"> put some here, particularly the ones that I'd ask them.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><strong>How is my order prepared? </strong></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Each batch of coffee is roasted on order! Your coffee is so fresh that we actually recommend waiting about 7 days off roast to brew it so the coffee can properly degas. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">With that, the time it takes for the coffee to degas to reach optimal flavor coincides perfectly with the time it takes for the coffee to ship so you're receiving the freshest coffee possible!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><strong>Should the coffee have a vacuum seal? </strong></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">You'll notice that our coffee isn't vacuum sealed. And the reason why is because you don't need it because we roast your coffee on order. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">A vacuum seal is only needed when buying coffee off the grocery store shelf where the coffee has been sitting for weeks if not months! Our bags that contain a one-way valve allowing the coffee to de-gas while minimizing oxidative degradation!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">As the coffee you order from us is roasted to order, you're getting the freshest coffee possible! And not coffee that has been roasted 30+ days ago!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><strong>The best way to store your coffee is…? </strong></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">An airtight container that is NOT clear. Place it in a cool, dry place like your pantry. You want your coffee beans or grounds to be away from light, heat, and moisture. Ground coffee and beans can last 6 months in the pantry.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Per its product description, <span style="color: #8b4513;">I should always cold brew this</span>, so that’s what I did. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">For the “blind” test, I used a method I found on YouTube. I used room temperature water, 17 grams of grounds with 250 ml water, and brewed it in room temperature for 12-13 hours.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The result? <span style="color: #20b2aa;"><strong>It was smooth</strong>.</span> I'm so used to robusta, so the smoothness of this stomach friendly coffee really surprised me. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Moreover, it’s pretty bodied too for an arabica coffee. And yes, it’s a <strong><span style="color: #8b4513;">low acid coffee indeed</span></strong>.<span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="#disclaimer"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">*</span></a></span></span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">It was kind of a mistake to try this one first, though, because I wasn’t used to tasting arabica yet. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto"><i class="far fa-frown-open fa-lg" style="color: #ffa700"></i><em> Everything felt weird to me</em>, so I tried adding just a bit of coconut sugar.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">I try not to make it a habit, so I didn’t add sugar every time I brew the probiotics coffee after.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Now, <span style="color: #20b2aa;"><strong>the fragrance/aroma of the coffee grounds is unbelievable</strong>.</span> In a good way.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>After following the guide</h5>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">I think the coffee’s a tad weaker. <span style="color: #20b2aa;">I read somewhere that brewing in the fridge or with cold water is going to produce weaker coffee.</span></span><span style="color: #20b2aa;" data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Perhaps that’s psychological. I mean <em>I know about that fact first</em>, so it could just be my brain telling me how it tasted.  <i class="far fa-grin-beam-sweat fa-lg" style="color: #ffa700"></i></span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto"><span style="color: #8b4513;"><strong>The guide says I should leave it for 12-24 hours.</strong></span> Maybe I should’ve left it for 24 hours so it wouldn’t have tasted weaker.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p>To clarify, I didn't drink the probiotics coffee for a week straight or something like that. <span data-contrast="auto"><i class="far fa-calendar-alt fa-lg" style="color: #20b2aa"></i></span></p>
<p>Therefore, <em><span style="color: #000000;">I can't tell you if my body changed or if this coffee helped me reduce something.</span></em></p>
<p>Despite that fact, I can tell you that every time I drank this Lifeboost Coffee product, <span style="color: #20b2aa;"><strong>my gut health became better.</strong></span></p>
<p>And it stayed that way the entire day.</p>

I said earlier that the first one I tried—the probiotics coffee—tasted weird. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">But I didn’t </span><span data-contrast="auto">wanna</span><span data-contrast="auto"> give up on arabica. </span><i class="far fa-grin-tongue fa-lg" style="color: #ffa700"></i> <span data-contrast="auto"><em>Before, I'd just say “this coffee is meh” and go back to my good old robusta.</em></span><em> </em></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">And I think my effort was fruitful in a way. I’m still not a huge fan of arabica, but with <span style="color: #20b2aa;"><strong>cold brew and the right ratio, it can definitely be good</strong>.</span></span><span style="color: #20b2aa;" data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">So in a way, <span style="color: #20b2aa;">I learned a lot from </span></span><span style="color: #20b2aa;">Lifeboost Coffee and got some benefits from the biotics brew too. </span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<li>Lifeboost<span data-contrast="auto"> Coffee says that its coffees are bodied and low-acid. I think they’re not lying here.<a href="#disclaimer"><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0000ff;">*</span></a><br />

</span>The first time it tasted sour to me, yes, <span style="color: #20b2aa;">but only because I’m used to robusta.</span><br />

<li>Through my research, I know that probiotics coffee isn’t something new.<br />
&nbsp<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"><br />
</span>But,<span style="color: #20b2aa;"><strong> I do think that Lifeboost</strong></span><span data-contrast="auto"><span style="color: #20b2aa;"><strong> Coffee’s pretty innovative</strong>.</span> Because, most coffee with probiotics I found were in liquid form.<br />
&nbsp</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"><br />
</span>And apparently you can make your own probiotics coffee, but you have to add some substance naturally rich with the good bacteria.<br />

<li>People who have never tried, shade grown coffee, sun-dried, spring-washed and the claims mentioned above should give this brand a try.<br />

It was a bundle of preloved Donald Duck weekly comic magazine and I was very happy to get that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, it was preloved and probably my parents got that from some random secondhand bookstore. But it was so special for me and up to nowadays I still keep it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was not only special because I loved the comic, but also because it was my first experience in learning reading.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since then, I loved to read and anytime I had the chance to get new books, I always demanded for it to my parents like crazy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, the reading habit that my parents sowed to me since my early age affected my whole life a lot up to nowadays.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I still love reading up to now and something I love more maybe is buying new books, because I always feel like new books means a new quest to be explored.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><i class="fas fa-walking fa-lg" style="color: #81e242"></i> Aand… Maybe that’s the reason why I hoard so many unread nowadays.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That’s might seem like something usual, but what makes me feel cringey about my habit is that most of those books are still left unread up until nowadays.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I may make up excuses for not reading those books, yet I still buy more new books. However, my excuse is very logical: time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don’t have that much time to read those books either starting new or complete the books I have read for several chapters and haven’t finished.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I need some free time to read the books, but I realized that I don’t have that much free time anymore compared to when I was younger.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My job (I'm a writer at <a href="http://earthbuddies.net">earthbuddies.net</a>) and my daily chores make me find it hard to allocate some time in daily basis to read a book.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong><i class="fas fa-caret-left fa-lg" style="color: #3e242e"></i> </strong></span><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Apparently, that’s not my problem alone.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My friend, who is a lecturer in a university also had the same problem. He bought a lot of books but only read a few of them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We had a conversation about it and it was the time I ran into a free webinar of <a href="https://buythiz.com/jimreadingmasterclass" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Super Reading by Jim Kwik</strong> </span></span></a>program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Long story short, the free webinar led me to purchase the Super Reading by Jim Kwik program, and it has been two weeks since I joined the program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #e82e2e;"><strong>Here I will tell you my experience in joining the program.</strong></span></p>

<h3>Stop Subvocalizing</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reading takes a lot of time, even though it sometimes doesn’t. At least, that’s what most people are thinking about the activity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That’s the reason why most of us, including me, feel like we need to spare a time to read a book. However, if you are able to read in super speed, you will find that reading is not really time consuming.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, how to improve our reading speed if we have been using the same speed since the beginning? I learned something interesting in <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff; text-decoration: underline;"><strong><a href="https://buythiz.com/jimreadingmasterclass" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Super Reading by Jim Kwik</a>.</strong></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong><i class="fas fa-atlas fa-lg" style="color: #3e242e"></i> </strong></span><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>We tend to use our inner voice while reading.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is called subvocalizing, and it is something pretty natural to do, since we usually also subvocalize our thoughts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Almost everyone does that, and the reason for it is because we are taught to do so in our school. The problem is, subvocalizing what we read makes our brain process information slower.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="12116" data-permalink="https://buythiz.com/review/super-reading-by-jim-kwik-review/attachment/super-reading-by-jim-kwik-8" data-orig-file="https://buythiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/super-reading-by-jim-kwik-8-e1612105611282.jpg" data-orig-size="450,300" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="super reading by jim kwik (8)" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://buythiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/super-reading-by-jim-kwik-8-300x200.jpg" data-large-file="https://buythiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/super-reading-by-jim-kwik-8-1024x683.jpg" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12116" src="https://buythiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/super-reading-by-jim-kwik-8-e1612105611282.jpg" alt="super reading by jim kwik (8)" width="450" height="300" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our brain can work faster in processing written words if there is no need for us to subvocalize what we read.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In example, when we read road signs or name tags, we don’t vocalize it but we can simply retain the information given by it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jim Kwik said that he recognized this common problem and uses groundbreaking neurostimulation techniques to help us retain written information faster.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #008000;"><span style="color: #000080;"><i class="fas fa-asterisk fa-lg" style="color: #3e3e31"></i> </span>The techniques guarantees it will increase our reading speed at least double in just 21 days.</span> </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know, sounds like a sophisticated and complicated program, doesn’t it? But based on my own experience in joining the program, the methods used are pretty simple.</p>

<h3>Super Reading: Harvest The Information Faster</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="12106" data-permalink="https://buythiz.com/review/super-reading-by-jim-kwik-review/attachment/small-super-reading" data-orig-file="https://buythiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/small-super-reading-e1612105683140.jpg" data-orig-size="449,247" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;sataksig&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1612123198&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="small super reading" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://buythiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/small-super-reading-300x165.jpg" data-large-file="https://buythiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/small-super-reading-1024x563.jpg" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12106" src="https://buythiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/small-super-reading-e1612105683140.jpg" alt="small super reading" width="449" height="247" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Okay, let’s get deeper about the program. What kind of thing that Super Reading actually offers?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In short, there are 3 main points that Super Reading offers for the purpose of helping us absorb written information faster.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Double Your Reading Speed:</strong></span> Harness science-backed neurostimulation techniques and proven speed-reading tools to break through the limiting ‘inner voice’ reading method that has greatly diminished your natural reading speed.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Achieve More, Faster:</strong></span> Discover how to apply your accelerated reading and learning speed towards your personal and professional goals &#8211; so you can multiply your productivity and get more done in record time.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Develop A Superhuman Memory:</span> </strong>Learn simple yet effective memory retention techniques that ensure you can not only absorb information faster &#8211; but also retain and use it at a moment’s notice.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From those points, we can draw a line that this program is working with our brain and memory by ‘hacking’ it with removing the ‘unwanted’ processing habits and ‘planting’ new processing habits.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And after the program, not only we can read faster, we will also get other benefits that will improve our daily activities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="12110" data-permalink="https://buythiz.com/review/super-reading-by-jim-kwik-review/attachment/super-reading-by-jim-kwik-2" data-orig-file="https://buythiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/super-reading-by-jim-kwik-2-e1612106621650.jpg" data-orig-size="450,338" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="super reading by jim kwik (2)" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://buythiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/super-reading-by-jim-kwik-2-300x225.jpg" data-large-file="https://buythiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/super-reading-by-jim-kwik-2-1024x768.jpg" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12110" src="https://buythiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/super-reading-by-jim-kwik-2-e1612106621650.jpg" alt="super reading by jim kwik (2)" width="450" height="338" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The program itself is delivered in <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>21-day online sessions in form of 10-25 minutes long video lecture</strong>. </span>But not only the lectures from Jim Kwik himself is important, because it is accompanied with activities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, the activities included in the program is the point that will determine the output, about how much improvement we will get or whether will this program works for you or not.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don’t say that the video is not important, because it contains all the information that we need to do the activities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But what I want to say is, make sure to do the activities fully-hearted because it determines the final result. All of them are pretty easy, except one that I will tell you later in the Pros & Cons.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is not my first meeting Jim Kwik in his program. Previously, I have joined his program called <a href="https://buythiz.com/review/superbrain-quest-jim-kwik-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Superbrain</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“If knowledge is power, learning is a superpower,” as quoted from a short note that Jim Kwik wrote in Superbrain. Jim Kwik is one of those people who believe everyone can unlock unlimited potentials by learning, no matter who they are.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jim Kwik is one of the world’s most in-demand accelerated learning experts amongst celebrities, professionals, and top performers. His clients are highly demanding ones like Harvard, Nike, Virgin, Fox Studios, and Singularity University.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The success story came from his own weakness, actually. Having suffered from traumatic childhood brain injuries at age five, he once thought that he would fail school, let alone adult life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, he survived the school life and reached success as an adult. He got through his hardest time by learning how to learn more effectively, to go in par with his other ‘normal’ friends.</p>

I didn’t naturally have these superpowers. They were learned. And if I can learn them, anyone can learn them – regardless of age, background or education,” he said as quoted from his official website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Superbrain and Super Reading are two of his masterpieces that focuses on mastering our own brains. “That world is within our reach. It starts with all of us learning how to master our brains – and I can show you how,” Kwik said.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, let’s talk about the activities that I should do during the program. The first week is about preparing what and how to read.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First thing first is of course <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>start reading a book at least 10 minutes a day</strong></span>, and schedule a routine time to read every day for a week.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I chose Haruki Murakami’s <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11297.Norwegian_Wood" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Norwegian Wood</a> for this practice, because I purchased this book about a year ago and haven’t read a single word out of it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After setting up the preparations, Jim Kwik taught me to <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>use visual pacer and a practice the introduced warming up technique</strong> </span>as the first upgrade for my reading habit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #00ff00;"><strong>Visual pacer is just the most basic technique.</strong> </span>Based on my experience, there are <span style="color: #00ff00;"><strong>at least 5 more step-by-step techniques</strong></span> to increase my reading speed in this program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moving on. The next steps are about ‘hacking’ my brain so that I could <span style="color: #000080;"><strong>stop subvocalizing</strong>.</span> The methods used are as simple as 1-2-3 and easy to practice, except one which I will tell you about it later in the Pros & Cons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And the final part of my two-weeks experience with Super Reading is about <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>boosting my reading comprehension</strong>,</span> which I think is the most serious part of this program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every single session is accompanied with workbook, so that we can track the changes in our reading speed. I will attach some screenshot of the workbook, but I will cover some contents in it to appreciate the author.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Spoiler alert,</span> sometimes your reading speed might not increase progressively because of the new ‘habits’ introduced by Jim Kwik.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, from my own experience after two weeks, my reading speed has increased significantly after overcoming the difficulties with the new ‘habits’ introduced.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will try to explain some points that I got from what I have learned from the program. First, about the obstacles of speed reading:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>We are only taught the<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong> basic technique of reading</strong></span>, and never re-learn reading afterward.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Our <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>minds are always wandering</strong> </span>while we are reading</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>We tend to <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>trackback</strong></span> when we think we miss some information in the book</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can relate with all of those problems. I didn’t even know that my reading level was still basic, my minds sometimes are wandering while reading a book, and if I miss something I will trackback.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe that many others can also relate to those problems, maybe including you. As I mentioned above, the reason why I decided to purchase the program is because I ran into its free webinar, which explains about those problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That’s why, the time Jim Kwik explained those mistakes, it hit me right at the spot. I decided to purchase <a href="https://buythiz.com/jimreadingmasterclass" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Super Reading by Jim Kwik</strong> </span></span></a> by following the link given after the free webinar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then joined the class immediately and discovered that the class is designed to be <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>21 sessions which are delivered day by day</strong> </span>one session for each day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then directly skimmed the curriculum of the program and check what’s the program could give me. I saw that the curriculum is neatly arranged.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking on the curriculum, I saw that the first week is about basic speed-reading techniques and preparation for further improvement for week two.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Here, I will tell you my experience weekly, starting from first week.</strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first week activities offer <span style="color: #07ab85;"><strong>around 25%</strong></span> in my reading speed, and to prove that the program gives a downloadable workbook for tracking my activities and improvements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first activities I needed to do in the first week is choosing my reading material and making note on my reading speed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I mentioned above, I chose Norwegian Wood for my practice book in this program. Using the technique given, I discovered that my starting reading speed <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>was around 270 words per minute (WPM).</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For your information, average readers go around 200-250 words per minute, so maybe I’m already slightly above average but not that far.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next step was to increase that number from time to time. One of the very first technique that Jim Kwik gave me to increase my reading speed is using visual pacer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Okay, I will explain about visual pacer a bit. It is an object that you use to trace the words you read. At first, I found it awkward using it and <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>my reading speed slowed down to 230 WPM!</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not only that, I also found it harder to understand the sentences I read. However, Kwik said that such kind of thing is normal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact, Jim Kwik said many times that slowing down and finding it harder to understand the sentences at first time using any of his techniques used in this program is normal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong><span style="color: #008000;"><i class="fas fa-arrow-right fa-lg" style="color: #8d1742"></i> </span>Once our brain gets used to the new techniques, Kwik guaranteed significant increase of reading speed and comprehension.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried to believe the statement because such kind of thing also happened during my experience with another program that Jim Kwik authored called <a href="https://buythiz.com/review/superbrain-quest-jim-kwik-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Superbrain</a>, that I have reviewed before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="mceTemp"></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I regained my reading speed at the fourth day after Kwik gave another trick to read faster. It was when I realized <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>I made a wrong move: trying to comprehend the words as I read.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first week is not about increasing my reading comprehension, but improving my reading speed alone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then re-watched all the first week’s video sessions <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>(yes, the videos are will always be accessible even after you finish the program)</strong></span> and re-write everything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apparently, after reprograming my sessions, I found out that my reading speed is <span style="color: #000080;"><strong>already at 330-340 WPM! Just around 25% increase that this program offered!</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, of course I felt satisfied that this program actually worked just like it promised. I decided that going on to the second week, I would pay more attention to the details to avoid making mistakes like I did earlier.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #02ba61;"><strong>Okay, moving on to the second week.</strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I mentioned above that I was going into the second week with 330-340 WPM. Now is the time to learn more advanced techniques to raise the number.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Talking about the sessions in second week I will divide it into two parts. First is advanced speed-reading techniques, and the second is basic techniques for improving comprehension.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The advanced speed-reading technique in second week includes overcoming subvocalization. Again, in this session my reading speed dropped.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;"><span style="color: #d10d0d;"><span style="color: #008000;"><i class="fas fa-caret-right fa-lg" style="color: #172d42"></i> </span></span></span>It significantly dropped to 250 WPM.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Erasing this habit was difficult for me, apparently. However, unlike when I did a mistake the week before, it was actually because my brain was getting ‘hacked’.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #d907ce;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><i class="fas fa-fire fa-lg" style="color: #dd1234"></i> </span>To regain the speed, Super Reading introduced a drill simply called Speed Drill, and I loved it.</span> </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Speed Drill brought the dimension of time into the activities, and maybe because of that I felt more challenged to read faster. As a result, in just a day I regained the reading speed I lost in just a day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let alone when a couple more technique was introduced to train my brain, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>I finally made significant improvement from around 340 WPM to 390 WPM by day 12!</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Talking about day 12, it was the time I entered the next step of the program which is to boost my comprehension.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #008000;"><span style="color: #08a873;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><i class="fas fa-heart fa-lg" style="color: #d27271"></i> </span></span>Apparently, boosting comprehension is as easy as “asking questions”.</span> </strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those are the examples of questions I asked, based on the book I read, before practicing the first ‘boosting comprehension’ exercise. Even while reading the book, I keep asking simple questions like above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apparently, by having those questions, not only I boosted my comprehension about the story I read, but also, <span style="color: #000080;"><strong>I could read faster up to 440 WPM</strong>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe because with this method I had a purpose to find the answers for those questions in the story, thus I can absorb more information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>That’s all about my two weeks experience with Super Reading by Jim Kwik.</strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I increased my reading speed from <span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>270 WPM to 440 WPM, with almost as good comprehension about my reading materials.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was planning to go straight into the third week, but because my wife had to visit her parents during the weekend.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, I planned to start doing it after I got home from my parents in law’s home. In between time, I will just continue practicing what I have learned in the last two weeks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By the way, talking about the third week, even though I haven’t practiced it yet, is about <span style="color: #008080;"><strong>improving the comprehension in speed reading further.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking on my experience with week two, I bet my reading speed would increase further as well as my comprehension.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And looking on the curriculum, there is one thing I realized earlier: there are some concepts in Super Reading program that makes it an eternal loop.</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>‘Eternal loop’? </strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, an eternal loop of increasing further our reading speed and comprehension even after we finish the program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I mean, some brain hacks and reading exercises are made to fix our bad habits and plant new good habits.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong><span style="color: #08a873;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><i class="fas fa-anchor fa-lg" style="color: #272d71"></i> </span></span>But some concepts included in the program (like visual pacer and brain training) are made to improve our reading speed after planting those new good habits.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Therefore, by repeating the improvement process like we did earlier in this program after erasing our good habits, we can moreover improve our pace.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #d907ce;"><strong>Although, I don’t think we can get as significant result as the first time doing this entire program.</strong></span></p>

<h3>Pros And Cons About This Program</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, as in the previous chapter I talked about the more ‘technical’ experience with the program. While here, I will talk about my view about the program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will make it as pros and cons, and give a brief explanation about what made me give such consideration about the points.</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff6600; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>PROS:</strong></span></span></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Result Can Be Seen Even Before Finishing The Program: </strong></span>If you read the previous chapter, you will notice that I have improved my reading speed from 270 WPM to 440 WPM.<br />
But reading fast is nothing without good comprehension, thus I should add that my comprehension about the story is almost as good as my starting point.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Author Is Legit Trainer:</span> </strong>This is not my first joining Jim Kwik’s program. I have previously joined his program called <a href="https://buythiz.com/review/superbrain-quest-jim-kwik-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Superbrain</a>, and I was satisfied with the result.<br />
Not only that, as I wrote above, you can check his portfolio in brain training that includes some big names.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="color: #008000;">Neat Curriculum, Lifetime Access, and Repeatable Process:</span> </strong>Simply said, once you purchase this program, you are given lifetime access to it so that you can further improve you results even after your final day of the quest.<br />
Don’t bother to start over, you can just jump into the technique or brain training part you want to improve and let the journey guides you further.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="color: #d907ce;">Explanations Are Easy To Understand:</span> </strong>Slicing the program into 21 pieces not only makes absorbing information easier, but also gives us time to practice the methods for the rest of the day.<br />
In my experience, the approximate time I dedicated each day for this program and read the book was only 60 minutes.<br />
10-25 minutes for the video session, 15 minutes for practicing the methods, and the rest of it for reading the book (even though sometimes I got carried away and spent more time to read the book using the introduced methods)</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #07ab85;"><strong>Supportive & Active Community Discussion: </strong></span>You are not doing this program alone, because this program is scheduled for every new student. In my case, I was doing it with 400 other attendees.<br />
What’s more interesting is, after each session you will be given option to discuss with other attendees or compare your results with them.<br />
Funny was, when I saw someone got higher number than me, I always felt more motivated to improve.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>15 Days 100% Money Back Guarantee: </strong></span>Look how I already improved my reading pace significantly after two weeks. What’s better about it, I actually still have the chance to ask for refund after gaining such improvements.<br />
This program provides 15 days 100% money back guarantee in case you are not satisfied with the program.<br />
Might be too short, but look at what I’ve got.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #deb204;"><strong>Free Webinar Available: </strong></span>I STRONGLY RECOMMEND YOU TO VISIT HIS FREE WEBINAR FIRST! This free webinar will not only give you clear sight about the full contents of this program.<br />
It will also give you a BONUS AND INCREDIBLE PRICE CUT at the end of it which I will tell you about later.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff6600; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>CONS:</strong></span></span></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Some Techniques Feel Uncomfortable At First: </strong></span>Before, I mentioned that the techniques introduced in this program might make reading feel uncomfortable at first.<br />
In my case, I even dropped my reading pace significantly instead of increasing it. However, after I got the grip, those techniques apparently made reading easier.<br />
But as I mentioned twice before, there is one particular technique included in the program that I found IMPOSSIBLE to do: juggling to improve your brain control.<br />
I still cannot juggle up to now even though I’ve tried for days. Luckily, juggling is not a main menu but rather an optional activity that we can choose to do or not.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Requires Great Determination & Motivation:</span> </strong>You definitely will not find this program easy if you don’t have the determination and motivation to do it because it includes a lot of brain training to get you out of comfort zone.<br />
Let alone if you don’t feel reading is an interesting thing. This program doesn’t teach you to grow an interest in reading, but rather how to channel your love in reading.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Might Be Pricey For Some People: </strong></span>Even though based on my experience Super Reading showed incredible result even before the program finish, this program comes with $299 price tags ($999 before discounts).<br />
That’s a bit too much money to spend if you don’t belong to middle-high class, moreover during this hard time of coronavirus pandemic.<br />
Indeed it offers 15 days 100% money back guarantee that you can make use of (or cheat on), but for some people that number is just too high. That’s why, later in this review I will tell you a method to make the price drops.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="color: #d907ce;">Not Suitable For Some Reading Materials:</span> </strong>In my opinion, this program has specific market of readers. What Super Reading by Jim Kwik teaches you is to gather information from written materials faster by focusing on words distribution and eliminating the needs for more details.<br />
Thus, this method might not be suitable for things that includes a long string of numbers, business contracts and papers, poetry, or any kind of materials that requires you to check and recheck each single word (or number) written on it.<br />
On the other hand, the most suitable reading materials to put this program into practice are such as newspapers, novels, student’s textbooks, or anything that will still give you good amount of information even if you don’t pay into details in every single words.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the pros and cons above, you might get the catch about whether this program is suitable for you or not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my opinion, the pros still outweigh the cons and thus I decided to continue finishing it instead of claiming its 15 days 100% money back guarantee.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I, myself, considered this program is worth it based on my reading hobby because my main mission is to eat up all the books that I have purchased, which will open up the door for me to purchase more books in the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the program, I have gone more than halfway of Norwegian Woods by Haruki Murakami. Almost 300 pages in just two weeks, compared to 120 pages in 9 days when I last read a book.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I feel satisfied with my result and I suppose to finish the book by the time I finish this program with my new WPM achievement.</p>

<h3>Testimonials From Other People</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you feel you can relate to my experience of hoarding too much book but still wanting more, you might also feel the urge to consume all those books before buying the new one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But just like me, you might also want to improve your reading speed because you don’t have that much time to read all those books in daily basis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then, if because of those reasons you are interested in joining Super Reading by Jim Kwik, you can purchase it from the link provided below for <strong>special price</strong> <strong>(lower than ordinary link provided by other sites). </strong></p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p>

</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I mentioned above, the price that you should pay from joining via the link provided above is <span style="color: #000080;"><strong>$299 </strong></span>(originally it was $999), and it comes with <span style="color: #deb204;"><strong>15 days 100% money back guarantee.</strong></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suggest you to take the all access one if you want to improve a lot of aspects in your life.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, as<span style="color: #07ab85;"><strong> I<span style="color: #ff0000;"> STRONGLY</span> recommended above, you should visit the free webinar page first.</strong></span> Not only because it will give you clear insight about the program, but also because you will be granted access to two benefits as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">Bonus</span>:</strong> 4x Group Coaching Call Recordings With Jim Kwik</li>
<li><span style="color: #02ba61;"><strong>Additional price cut</strong></span> which makes the program is accessible for <span style="color: #0000ff;"><b>even lower price for both access!</b></span></li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #d907ce; text-decoration: underline;">Visit this link for the free webinar:</span></strong></span></p>

</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Verdict And Conclusion</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, after two weeks of joining the program, did I find this program satisfying?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, to answer that question, I want state that this program has successfully improved my reading speed <span style="color: #008080;"><strong>from 270 WPM to 440 WPM </strong></span>in two weeks<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And that increase in words per minute happened even before I finished the complete program. That’s why, in my own opinion I would say that this program is successful to help me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #e82e2e;"><strong><span style="color: #993366;"><i class="fas fa-minus-circle fa-lg" style="color: #34dada"></i> </span>Of course, I am satisfied with my current result, especially since the program requires a great determination to practice.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let alone when the program itself is granting <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>lifetime access</strong> </span>for even further improvement and great support in its closed community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, as I found this program might be <span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>a bit pricey</strong> </span>and how the <span style="color: #000080;"><strong>result can differ greatly</strong></span> between users according to testimonials I found, you may want to think carefully before joining the program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for your material for consideration, again <span style="color: #07ab85;"><strong>I <span style="color: #ff0000;">STRONGLY</span> recommend you to visit the free webinar first</strong></span> by following the link provided above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While if you have already purchased the program and don’t find it satisfying, you can claim your <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>100% money back guarantee</strong></span> before 15 days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://buythiz.com/gomwordfreeclass" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0000ff;"><strong>The M Word by Emily Fletcher Review After 2 Weeks &#8211;</strong></span></a> What was the last delicious meal you have eaten recently? Was the deliciousness of the meal able to satisfy both your body and your soul?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, talking about satisfying your physical appetite with delicious meal is easy, but satisfying your soul with mere physical food is not that easy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, how do we satisfy the ‘hunger’ of the soul? That’s the point we are going to talk about. Just like our physical body, our soul can also feel the ‘hunger’, and we also need to feed it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><i class="fas fa-walking fa-lg" style="color: #81e242"></i> <span style="color: #ff0000;">Our body and soul work hand in hand every single time, and a conflict between those two will more likely give our whole being a hard time coping with reality.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In example, when you are doing a job that you don’t really like, you will still get paycheck for what you do. However, your lack of excitement to do the job will burden you with negativity.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other hand, when you are in a vacation, you are more likely to be happy. However, we cannot live only by going into beautiful beaches and drinking coconut.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have to deal with the real world by balancing the scale between fulfilling our physical needs and spiritual needs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong><i class="fas fa-atlas fa-lg" style="color: #3e242e"></i>  One way to bring balance in those two things is to meditate in between our daily activities.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But meditation is not as easy as it seems, especially when you have demanding daily activities that will always disrupt your minds when trying to practice your mediation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong><i class="fas fa-asterisk fa-lg" style="color: #3e3e31"></i>  I experienced it earlier, and found it actually difficult to meditate during my free time.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I found out that having a good guidance will help much, such as joining a session held by professional meditation guru.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, it would be a very pricey decision. Let alone when I am currently in need of some savings for welcoming my baby in short future.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We all know, right, that welcoming a baby is a very tense situation for both our physical and spiritual selves. We got the pressure to work harder, but we also need to stabilize our minds under that circumstance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My boss, who knew about my condition suggested me to join an online program that will give me a good guide to meditate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #d10d0d;"><strong><span style="color: #008000;"><i class="fas fa-caret-right fa-lg" style="color: #172d42"></i> </span>The program is entitled The M Word by Emily Fletcher. </strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://buythiz.com/gomwordfreeclass" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0000ff;"><strong>The M Word by Emily Fletcher</strong></span></a> is a good option for us to have a good guide in practicing meditation, that’s not as pricey as joining sessions held by professional meditation guru.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, this is indeed a program held by a professional meditation guru, Emily Fletcher herself, that you can practice anytime anywhere. But it doesn’t come with the pricey price tag like other programs offer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In example, another program authored by Emily Fletcher called Ziva Meditation costs $399 with only 15 sessions. <span style="color: #008080;"><strong>That's $100 more with less than half the sessions!</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Up until the moment I write this review, I have joined the program for more than 2 weeks.</strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not only it has guided me to meditate from the very basic step and eliminate all my wrong moves, I also discovered good amount of useful information and inspiration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is where I will honestly tell you what I experienced during the first 2 weeks of joining the program.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, what’s the deal with meditation? Why is it mentioned so many times as both a necessity yet elusive activity?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong><i class="fas fa-arrow-right fa-lg" style="color: #8d1742"></i> <span style="color: #08a873;">It is a necessity because like mentioned above, this is a food for our soul. </span></strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/9-ways-to-make-meditation-easier" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Health Line</a>, the purpose of meditating is to help learning how the nature works around us and how it has led us into our current situation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meditation is about how to let go of our past selves and let our future flows just as it is. Thus, we will be able to erase both our past guilts and our worries in welcoming the future moments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this case, the relaxing sensation and well-being is the aftertaste that we all pursue from doing the activity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, it will also bring many beneficial effects in our daily lives by making us become more productive, generally become happier, reduce our stress level, become more self-aware, and many more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><i class="fas fa-fire fa-lg" style="color: #dd1234"></i> But why doesn’t everyone meditate every day if it can bring us so many beneficial effects?</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the thing that I want to talk about. Meditation, even though it seems so easy, is actually a very elusive activity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #08a873;"><strong>Concentrating or clearing our minds amidst this hectic world is not an easy job to do</strong></span>, especially when our daily activities are so demanding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Things will get harder if this is our first time in learning about meditation, like “what to think about?”, or “what to do to clear our minds?”, or maybe “how to breathe correctly?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://buythiz.com/gomwordfreeclass" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0000ff;"><strong>The M Word by Emily Fletcher</strong></span></a> is the course that provides the answer for those questions. It gives good amount of information and inspiration to our pursue for good meditation from very basic level.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not only from the program itself, but also from incredible additional supports included in the program that you can enjoy from the very first session.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I say that? Because I have joined the program for 2 weeks, and thus I want to share my experience with you.</p>

<h3>Clearing The Myths With The M Word</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the things that makes meditation difficult is the myths surrounding it. The M Word not only explains it, but also how to go around it for better experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The myths surrounding meditation are such as that the practice would be boring, requires you “to clear your mind” or “focus on the breathing”, not fun at all, and it takes a long time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the examples I know about myths surrounding meditation is that we need to be able to completely get lost from real world and connect with nature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course that's something very difficult to do, because we don't even know what kind of state that we should get into.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another myth surrounding meditation is that we should always enter sleep-like trance to  show results. Of course, that's something too sophisticated to reach for beginners.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let alone saying to reach both of those  we have to keep our minds clear from any thoughts, or simply said leaving it empty. How?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Luckily, The M Word uses different approach to meditation to make it easier to practice for beginners, but not with less effective effects.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #08a873;"><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;"><i class="fas fa-heart fa-lg" style="color: #d27271"></i> </span>Emily's step by step explanation will tackle those myths one by one.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The lessons are taught by Emily Fletcher herself with video instruction that will be given to you day by day for 33+6 days including the warming up sessions and bonuses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each session you get will guide you step by step in slowly but steady pace to build the most suitable meditation method for each of us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>The sessions last no longer than 20 minutes and will be given to you every morning.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thus, you can join and do the program every day in your freshest condition after waking up, but you can also access it anytime you have free time in a day.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>I considered none of them was boring or too hard to understand and practice.</strong> </span>Even after 15 days straight joining the program, I still feel excited to join my morning session every day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another good thing about this program is, even if you somehow skip a session for any reason, you can visit it back and continue the progress afterward.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I consider the daily content provided by the program really suits my time management. In addition, from my own experience, the myths surrounding meditation practice has been debunked by The M Word.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh, my little note to you is not to skip the warming up session because it will help you explain how to consume the program, in addition to it also gives you the bonuses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And another thing that you should not skip is this <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>free masterclass</strong> </span>about meditation by Emily Fletcher herself. Check the link below out.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, what will we learn from this program? Mainly, there are four things that you can learn from this program:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Practice Deeper Meditation: </strong></span>this course will help you enter deeper states of mind so that you can get accelerated professional and personal growth.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Achieve Meditation Mastery: </strong></span>Emily’s approach will help you to master your own meditation practice suitable for yourself.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Enhance Your Intuition:</strong></span> this is one of the benefits you can get from a good meditation. Surely it will lead to many good things, especially for your personal and professional life.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>Embody Resilience to Stress: </strong></span>imagine what can you do if you are stress-free. You can even transform your life into a better one.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And to acquire those things, Emily Fletcher composed the program and divide it into two main parts with each part has its own curriculum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #08a873;"><strong>First part is Up Leveling Your Meditation Practice.</strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This part will provide you the information about basics of meditation and tweaks in your daily lives. This first part lasts for 17 straight days, and you will learn such as:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Basic methods</strong> </span>of achieving good meditation</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>The science</strong></span> behind meditation</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Why <span style="color: #000080;"><strong>meditation is important</strong> </span>for us</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>Stress management</strong> </span>and how to add calmness to our hectic days</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>How to make our minds stay <span style="color: #800080;"><strong>still and calm</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #08a873;"><strong>Second part is Up Leveling Your Life.</strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This part is not less important than the first part. While the first part talks about the basics and tweaks, this is the part where things are put into practice in daily lives for 16 days straight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This part consists of <strong><span style="color: #800080;">guided meditations, implementation, and pre-recorded Q & A with Emily Fletcher</span> </strong>herself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It got me excited when I first read the curriculum and found out that the second part put everything in theory into practice for specific uses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Talking about the guided meditation alone, it includes the guide of meditation for easing pain, reducing stress level, having better sleep, work, forgiveness, sex, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, here I give you an access to the <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>free masterclass</strong> </span>with Emily Fletcher, so that you can get an insight about what the program is about.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the proofs that The M Word is a descent program is that the instructor of the program is the creator, Emily Fletcher, herself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong><i class="fas fa-minus-circle fa-lg" style="color: #dada34"></i>  </strong></span><span style="color: #08a873;"><strong>But why having Emily Fletcher as instructor makes it a descent program?</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Emily Fletcher is a certified master of meditation and the advisor of meditation to big companies in the class of Google, Harvard Business School, Summit Series, Viacom, A-Fest & The Omega Center.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Her clients are including top performers such as Oscar, Grammy and Tony award winners, as well as NBA athletes, and CEOs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, she is not a newcomer in meditational works, since she is also the founder of Ziva Meditation program and the author of Stress Less, Accomplish More.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Being a Broadway actress, she was under constant pressure and stress. She suffered from insomnia, lack of energy, and overwhelming level of anxiety that made her hair turned gray in the age of 27.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One day, she ran into another actress who could handle the pressure and performed magnificently. Emily asked for the secret behind that actress’ calmness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #d10d0d;"><strong>“Meditation,” the actress replied.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was at this moment Emily began her journey. She studied meditation and tried to find the best way to achieve such high level of calmness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She spent years of studying ancient practices in India and finally created Ziva Meditation, a mental technique that combines the stress-relieving benefits of meditation with the mental clarity of mindfulness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #008000;"><i class="fas fa-caret-down fa-lg" style="color: #8d1742"></i> </span><span style="color: #000080;">The M Word is her program created specifically to bring meditation into more practical with modern approaches.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Emily picked the parts of her knowledge and share it in The M Word to help others achieve extraordinary performance through mediation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Okay, enough talking about the program from its surface. Let’s talk about my personal experience after joining the program for 2 weeks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong><i class="fas fa-caret-left fa-lg" style="color: #8d14d2"></i> First thing first, I want to talk about the insides of The M Word.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I mentioned above, the program is divided into 33+6 days sessions with each session lasts only less than 20 minutes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The thing about dividing the program into bite-size sessions given every morning is that I could focus and practice one specific lesson every day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #08a873;"><strong>I discovered that this program is arranged neatly in a curriculum that allow you to improve your understanding about meditation in sequence.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In example, Emily taught me about the breathing technique first before coming into my senses, and finally how to add silence and gratitude into the things I learned before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Further, it also taught me how to put all those things together and how to grow the whole thing into a habit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To make things less boring, Emily uses various medias to teach the lessons. The medias used are including video, audio, and PDF journal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #993366;"><i class="fas fa-minus-circle fa-lg" style="color: #34dada"></i> </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">I see this teaching method pretty similar like how teachers are teaching ABCs first to children before guiding them how to write a sentence.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Particularly in the first part of the program, the next lesson is built upon previous lessons so that everyone in the program can have a solid foundation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And if you ever have a question you want to ask to the teacher, you can either check the provided Q & A session or go to discussion page and submit your question to the other attendees.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong><span style="color: #993366;"><i class="fas fa-caret-down fa-lg" style="color: #23dd12"></i> </span>One little clue about the meditation method that Emily taught me is, you don't have to sit in a yoga-like stance. You can just sit back and relax.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh, yes, I should also mention that the program is a scheduled program so that you are most likely taking the program in the same time as other attendees.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having other people doing the program with you made me more comfortable because you can discuss and compare your progress with other people in closed community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;"><span style="color: #993366;"><i class="fas fa-caret-down fa-lg" style="color: #dd3412"></i> </span></span>In my opinion, The M Word is literally similar to other online classes we could take during this coronavirus pandemic.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, let’s go further into my impression to the contents provided in The M Word. First, let’s talk about how Emily taught me the basics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div id="attachment_11632" style="width: 1044px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11632" data-attachment-id="11632" data-permalink="https://buythiz.com/review/the-m-word-review-emily-fletcher/attachment/video-example" data-orig-file="https://buythiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/video-example.jpg" data-orig-size="1034,503" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;sataksig&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1610793614&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="video example" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://buythiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/video-example-300x146.jpg" data-large-file="https://buythiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/video-example-1024x498.jpg" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-11632" src="https://buythiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/video-example.jpg" alt="video example" width="1034" height="503" srcset="https://buythiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/video-example.jpg 1034w, https://buythiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/video-example-300x146.jpg 300w, https://buythiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/video-example-1024x498.jpg 1024w, https://buythiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/video-example-767x373.jpg 767w, https://buythiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/video-example-1536x747.jpg 1536w, https://buythiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/video-example-2048x996.jpg 2048w, https://buythiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/video-example-308x150.jpg 308w, https://buythiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/video-example-100x49.jpg 100w, https://buythiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/video-example-719x350.jpg 719w, https://buythiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/video-example-788x383.jpg 788w" sizes="(max-width: 1034px) 100vw, 1034px" /><p id="caption-attachment-11632" class="wp-caption-text">The preview of lesson video</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using mostly video and audio, Emily uses simple language that I could easily understand and analogies that are easy to comprehend.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In example, in teaching the Balancing Breath Technique of part 1, Emily uses “You can think about this like pulling the bow back, and then let your body surrender into meditation” to explain how to breathe correctly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I simply understood how to enter a meditating state with that analogy, especially after Emily explained how to control our breathing technique.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second, let’s talk about the practicality of the practices. In addition to how the lesson is delivered daily, the way Emily uses ‘silly’ movements to do the practices actually made it easier for me to practice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One spoiler for this case is the breathing technique (again).<span style="color: #000080;"><strong> It involves covering your nostrils in such peculiar way while breathing in an out,</strong></span> so that you can have clearer picture on how to control your breath.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That’s why, she sometimes suggested to do the practice alone in case you don’t want to look silly around other people. Silly and easy yet effective method even for beginners.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Oh,</span><span style="color: #000000;"> and another thing that I should mention about this course is, it doesn't instruct you to enter some unk</span><span style="color: #000000;">nown state if you are beginner!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Emily's approach in The M Word just allows you to feel whatever you feel in the process as long as you enjoy it.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She mentioned herself that you are allowed to feel sleepy, have some thoughts while you are meditating, and even correcting your sitting position.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I experienced all of those things when I first practiced the program, but slowly things changed. During my second half of joining it, I experienced something like being secluded from this earth in positive way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>In my own experience, I found it more acceptable because getting sleepy during meditation is our body's natural reaction to calmness.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Third, let’s talk about the support system from both the community and the program itself. From the community discussion, I currently do the program with 298 other people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Not all of them are active in the group discussion, but I found that you will likely always get some responses when you ask questions since some members are really active in it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While for the support system provided by the program itself, I found that in The M Word community there are more than 28,000 members with more than 2,300 posts.</p>
<div class="mceTemp"></div>
<p>Worry not about clouded support, the program provides highlighted topics according to each session provided by the program.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fourth thing I want to talk about in this program is the result of all the lessons I learned from the program. This is where I started to notice about the effect of The M Word.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like I mentioned above, I used to go through hectic days that slowly but sure piled up my stress level. It resulted in something that I didn’t realize but taken its toll on me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;"><span style="color: #993366;"><i class="fas fa-caret-up fa-lg" style="color: #dd2323"></i> </span></span>The stress level actually disrupted my night sleep.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It resulted in so many things that affected both my physical and mental condition, including acid reflux that I solved with <a href="https://buythiz.com/review/acid-reflux-strategy-scott-davis-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Acid Reflux Strategy by Scott Davis</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My night sleep has been ruins for months and I didn’t realize that before The M Word led me into meditation before sleeping and after waking up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;"><span style="color: #993366;"><i class="fas fa-caret-left fa-lg" style="color: #dd2323"></i> </span></span></strong></span><span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>So how could I realize that? The second day I followed the suggestion, I could really sleep like a baby!</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The program instructed me to let go of my train of thoughts before sleep, and not to welcome it any sooner than after my morning meditation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong><i class="fas fa-sign fa-lg" style="color: #d123d1"></i> Apparently, that was how the program helped me to fix my sleeping habits.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not only I didn’t wake up in the middle of the night again, but also, I actually felt sleepy on the bed, fell asleep faster, and woke up fresher.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My sleep quality really improved and it led to instant boost on my moods and emotion, work performance, even my physical condition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong><i class="fas fa-jedi fa-lg" style="color: #39e172"></i><span style="color: #04a2db;"> I know that Emily didn’t make this program to improve my sleep quality, but apparently this is the point that I actually needed yet never realized.</span></strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, after the 12<sup>th</sup> day, you will likely get the idea on how to meditate and trigger the effects by yourself. <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>That’s how educative this program is.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="11628" data-permalink="https://buythiz.com/review/the-m-word-review-emily-fletcher/attachment/the-m-word-meditation-3" data-orig-file="https://buythiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/the-m-word-meditation-3.jpg" data-orig-size="752,500" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="the m word meditation 3" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://buythiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/the-m-word-meditation-3-300x199.jpg" data-large-file="https://buythiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/the-m-word-meditation-3-1024x681.jpg" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11628" src="https://buythiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/the-m-word-meditation-3.jpg" alt="the m word meditation 3" width="526" height="350" srcset="https://buythiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/the-m-word-meditation-3.jpg 752w, https://buythiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/the-m-word-meditation-3-300x199.jpg 300w, https://buythiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/the-m-word-meditation-3-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://buythiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/the-m-word-meditation-3-767x510.jpg 767w, https://buythiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/the-m-word-meditation-3-1536x1021.jpg 1536w, https://buythiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/the-m-word-meditation-3-2048x1362.jpg 2048w, https://buythiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/the-m-word-meditation-3-226x150.jpg 226w, https://buythiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/the-m-word-meditation-3-100x66.jpg 100w, https://buythiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/the-m-word-meditation-3-526x350.jpg 526w, https://buythiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/the-m-word-meditation-3-788x523.jpg 788w" sizes="(max-width: 526px) 100vw, 526px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, the reason why I continue doing the program even though I already had the fix I need is to discover what kind of improvement The M Word can offer beside that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of those things are explained in <span style="color: #de4390;"><strong>short videos and audios</strong></span>, so that you can catch the instruction more clearly than just reading about it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to that, in some sessions, you will also be given <span style="color: #0aa14e;"><strong>pdf modules</strong> </span>as a media to do the checklists and for introspection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Okay. Now the next thing I want to share about this program is about <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>the ‘cringey’ things that somehow it has been built on </strong></span>based on my experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meditation is a kind of technique used to train our attention and awareness so that we can reach mindfulness, focus, and stable emotion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This practice is an old art of soul empowerment that approximately has been around the earth for more than 3 millennia.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Monks are the ones known to practice it in daily basis, because it is part of their religion. No wonder that we all are expecting something more Zen from this program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong><i class="fas fa-caret-right fa-lg" style="color: #aa88ad"></i> However, that might be not the thing that Emily is pursuing and teaching with The M Word.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Emily is literally converting the practice into something more modern and our results of learning this course is measured with modern life measurement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The M Word is not aiming to bring you the Zen, but instead to make you more productive for modern purposes like work, relationship, and stress management.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I felt like the teaching took away the real essence of meditation, and replace it with another core more suitable for modern life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From my own experience, I felt like The M Word basically instructs you to accept modern world capitalism, but deal with it without taking its toll on your body and soul.</p>

In short, it doesn’t teach you the ‘branch’ of meditation to make yourself better for the world, but rather teaches you how to get a promotion from performing better at your job.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;"><i class="fas fa-asterisk fa-lg" style="color: #6d2d21"></i> </span>Not a bad thing, I know. But I felt like this program is not as ‘pure’ as it should be.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a good program for you if you want to jump into meditation directly for any purposes related to your daily lives, but you might not reach the depth of experiencing the Zen of monks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second thing I want to talk about is for who this program aims to teach, because it seems kind of limiting its ‘market’.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #08a873;"><strong>Meditation is for everyone, and you can see that from how Tibetan monks are ranging from children to those who have passed 100 years old milestone.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But from the sessions held by Emily herself, I think the language, the point of view used, and the goals set didn’t reflect such age range.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can tell it from the title of the sessions alone, especially the Guided Meditation ones, which are set to improve stress management, sex, work, pep talk, better sleep, and celebrating success.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;"><i class="fas fa-arrow-right fa-lg" style="color: #6d2d21"></i> </span>The scoop of The M Word seems like only aiming to teach those who are in productive age.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indeed, our current productive age population are the ones who need it most, but we are not the only ones who want to learn about meditation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let alone how this program makes it so easy to do. I think people outside productive age would also love the teaching method used in this program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes I wonder how many people joined this program and didn’t like it for those two things I mentioned above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Luckily those people would not lose their money because this program provides <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>15 days money back guarantee no question asked.</strong></span></p>

<p>I found some testimonials about this program, and I picked some of it for comparison with my own testimonial. Some of them are big names:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>“People have noticed a change”</strong></p>
<p><em>&#8220;I used to think, &#8216;I can’t ever quiet my mind, how can I learn to meditate?' After the Ziva course I know that even if I am having thoughts, it is still working. Now it is a part of my daily ritual and people have noticed a change: they say, &#8216;you look so radiant!'&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><strong>Jenna Dewan</strong> (Actress, Host, World of Dance)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;I'm more prepared to go through difficult times&#8221;</strong></p>
<p><em>I feel that since I've finished the M Word program and began practicing meditation, I'm more prepared to go through difficult times. Meditation is very helpful in releasing stress and giving you tools to re encounter your base. It also works well on your spirituality.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><strong>Thierry Zajdner</strong> (Owner of Diamond dealing company)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>“JOY!”</strong></p>
<p><em>Just pure, unadulterated joy and, from the outside looking in, it probably looks like there's no good reason for it, hehehehe!</em></p>
<p><em>And so, I ask myself what reason do we actually need to feel joyous in the first place? Do we need a reason? Can Joy not be our natural setting? I know for sure that I'd like it to be mine on a ready-steady basis!!!! Thanks so much YET AGAIN, Emily :))))</em></p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><strong>Eli McCarthy </strong>(Member of discussion forum)</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>“So gorgeous”</strong></p>
<p><em>I cried during the Love Bomb. To be reminded of such love, feel it and then give it out on all the levels is deeply moving. I felt merged with the Universe and it with me and I love the wave/ocean analogy and feel it's powerful oneness.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on the thing I mentioned above, you might realize that The M Word is a quick jump into meditation, but sadly it is not for everyone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #08a873;"><strong>So, who can actually squeeze all the juices from this program?</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I drew a conclusion that the ones who can get the full benefits of this program are people who live and are living this modern life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most of us who are currently in productive age would get the benefits because we are dealing with modern days problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;"><i class="fas fa-heart fa-lg" style="color: #de31e1"></i> </span>This program is providing modern meditation method as solution to those modern problems.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But if you are looking for a more soulful meditation guide, or you are trying to cut your tie with this 21<sup>st</sup> century capitalism with Zen meditation, surely this is not the program you are searching for.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The M Word is more about improving yourself rather than how to becoming one with the universe.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to learn about meditation in depth, this program might not be suitable for you. But if you want more practical style of meditation, this one is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are also not currently dealing with modern days problems and activities, this program might not benefit you so much. On the other hand, if you have demanding job, you might need it more than you thought.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on my explanation about The M Word above, do you think this program is for you? If yes and you want to try this program, you can purchase it here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0aa14e;"><strong><span style="color: #08a873; text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #008000; text-decoration: underline;"><i class="fas fa-arrow-down fa-lg" style="color: #ee1141"></i> </span></span>Simply follow this link to purchase the program <span style="color: #008000; text-decoration: underline;"><i class="fas fa-arrow-down fa-lg" style="color: #ee1141"></i></span></strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://buythiz.com/gomword" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" style="border-radius:5px" class="wpsm-button gold big"><i class="rhicon rhi-check-circle"></i> CLICK HERE TO PURCHASE </a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By following the link, you will have two choices. First is to purchase the digital access of the entire program, and second is yearly subscription to unlock all access to every Mindvalley contents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The original cost of the program is <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">$999</span>, </strong>but by following the link provided above you can get 70% discount and get it for only <span style="color: #000080;"><strong>$299.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is another option provided by the program if you want to pay in 2 installments of <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>$159</strong> </span>each, which makes the total of <span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>$318.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While yearly subscription to every Mindvalley contents will cost you <span style="color: #993366;"><strong>$499 (worth more than $12,000).</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, personally I thought that was a pricey decision to have. But after joining it for 15 days, I felt that this program is actually worth the price.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My other consideration was knowing that another program held by Emily Fletcher called Ziva Meditation <span style="color: #800000;"><strong>costs $100 more with half of the sessions to have</strong>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let alone when knowing that your purchase will be covered by <span style="color: #08a873;"><strong>15 days money back guarantee no question asked</strong></span> in case you are not satisfied with the results or the process for both of those choices.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From my review above, you might get mixed feelings about this program, and that’s pretty acceptable. Let alone when you discovered that the program costs almost $300.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In one hand, this program provides easy-to-follow guides into meditation and neatly arranged curriculum that will improve our daily lives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But on the other hand, this program doesn’t give you the ‘pure’ meditation that you might want to learn. Let alone when you don’t aim to make meditation as a method to improve your productiveness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, looking at the results of the program that I got, in addition to comparing it to another program of Emily Fletcher called Ziva Meditation, I still think this program is worth it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still, I know that it is my own opinion that might be different with yours.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In that case, to help you decide whether this program is suitable for you or not, <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>you might want to check Meditation For Super Performance Masterclass with Emily Fletcher first.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This masterclass is free to access from the link below, and it will give you the clues about what The M Word really is about.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even if you are really interested in this program,<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong> I still strongly suggest you to visit the free masterclass first </strong></span>because at the end of it<span style="color: #0ecf48;"> <strong>you will get special access to further discount!</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Without checking out this free masterclass, you should pay <span style="color: #000080;"><strong>$299</strong> </span>for The M Word. However, at the end of the free masterclass, you will be offered access to the program for <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>$50 less!</strong></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Verdict And Conclusion</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on my 15 days experience with <a href="https://buythiz.com/gomwordfreeclass" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0000ff;"><strong>The M Word by Emily Fletcher</strong></span></a>, I found that this program has three points to praise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First is the <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>curriculum is served in such neat way</strong></span> that I felt like I could absorb the information easily and understand it in ease.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second, the <span style="color: #000080;"><strong>practices are so easy</strong> </span>to do even though some might look ‘silly’ to do, yet are so effective. Emily explained the practices so clearly and even show how to do it in the videos.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Third, <span style="color: #08a873;"><strong>I could solve my problem in a way I didn’t imagine</strong>,</span> by giving me better sleep. For me, it proves that this program covers a wide area of solution, but will mainly fix your problem from the aspect that needs fixing the most first.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, this program is too focused in one side of meditation that I think it completely ignores the other side of it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>not the program that will guide you into the Zen part of meditation</strong></span>, and rather focuses in providing quick fix to your daily problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In that case, if you are looking for a method to learn “monk’s” meditation in a purpose of <strong>“<span style="color: #ff6600;">how can I become a better person for this world?”</span></strong>, this is not the right program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, if you are still confused about what this program offers or doesn’t offer, you should check <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Meditation For Super Performance Masterclass </strong></span>first.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Hero Genius Legend by Robin Sharma</strong> &#8211; Did you promise yourself that this year of 2021 would be the year when you become more productive?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you like many other people in this world who subscribe to the notion to have &#8220;new year resolutions&#8221;?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s high five if you do!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know how many of us flunk last year but this year let's hope!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So in a search for new inspiration as an attempt to accomplish my new-year resolutions I found a seemingly helpful program called <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://buythiz.com/goherolegend" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Hero Genius Legend</span></a> </strong></span>launched by Mindvalley.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mindvalley itself is not new to me, I’ve tried some of its programs before, and they uniquely good.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, Other than <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://buythiz.com/review/jeffrey-allen-duality-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><span style="color: #0000ff; text-decoration: underline;">the previous</span></strong></a></span> Mindvalley’s programs that I’ve tried before, which were quite esoteric, <strong>this one is different; it’s created based on scientific research and study </strong>(mostly in human behavior and neuroscience).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This program also claimed to be battle-tested, proven by many people throughout the world, and currently holds more than 30k active users.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not only that, even world high profiles and organization like famous celebrities to Nike and Microsoft trust the author of Hero Genius Legend.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But is it really <strong><em>that</em></strong> good though?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To find out, here I am spending 25 days enrolling in the battle-tested, scientific-based, 66-day quest of Hero Genius Legend.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, without any further ado, let’s get to know the person behind Hero Genius Legend; why would world-famous figures and top organizations give him a place for recognition?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, apart from his world’s recognition and credentials that he possesses right now; in one of his appearances, he stated that he saw himself as a humble servant and he was no different from other people instead.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Robin also added that he wasn’t always like this; he wasn’t born with a silver spoon in his mouth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact, he’s coming from very a humble beginning. He was born to immigrant parents and had a hard time growing up. Nevertheless, those hardships didn’t make him have a victim mentality, conversely, he made it to be who he is right now</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, his journey to achieve what he currently has is not easy.  He even shared that his professional journey was started in a very modest way. In his first seminar, for instance, only twenty-three people attended, and twenty-one of them are his own family.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But here’s what makes him special; he didn’t give up. His conviction and consistency in what he’s doing made him rises to this point where he can stand on the same stage as other world’s leading figures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And now with the knowledge as well as the experiences that he gained for the last two decades; he dedicated it to create this <strong>Hero Genius Legend</strong> program and use it to help and reach out to more people around the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What is Hero Genius Legend?</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This program started with an illustration of a little boy and his father. One of the lines says:</p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #800080;"><strong><em>“Once I got the person together, the world is okay”</em></strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through that quote, the belief revolves; this program convinced that every big and revolutionary change in one’s life (career, promotion, doubled income, remarkable impact, masterpiece creation, etc) firstly started with the revolutionary change in oneself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And as we all know change is never easy, most people fall back again, and never knew how to harness their true potential; so this time, Robin Sharma together with Mindvalley built a 66-day quest called <strong>Hero Legend Genius</strong> to rescue those “in need”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This program emphasizing:</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #800080;"><strong>“The revolutionary approach to transforming your habits”</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And by &#8220;revolutionary approach&#8221;, means that every lesson featured here is the result of Robin Sharma’s 20+ years of professional experience working closely with high-impact people PLUS related scientific studies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through these 66 days, you’ll be able to master the concept <strong>2x3x mindset</strong>. This is where you finally know exactly how to double your income & impact, triple your focus & investment in two key areas: personal mastery and professional capability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But how this program so sure to help us master those key areas? Aren’t there many other programs just like this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To answer those questions&#8230; here is:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>How This Program Different from Other Programs?</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First and foremost, as I’ve mentioned earlier, <span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>this program is the result of Robin Sharma’s leadership coaching with many of the world’s successful figures for over 20 years. </strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What’s more?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>This program is apt, straight to the point, no wishy-washy</strong></span> (lesson only takes not more than 10 minutes per day).</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>Baby-step learning</strong></span>, Just like many other Mindvalley’s programs, Hero Genius Legend will also give you a smaller chunk of lesson material each day.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, there’s a novelty presented specifically in this program called “implementation day”, which basically “a day off” of learning. It’s only a small addition to the quest but I think it has a huge impact to learn and absorb the lessons better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>It’s scientific</strong></span>; mostly based on human behavior and neuroscience studies. Through this scientific approach, the positive changes you’ll get with this program will be lasting.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you came across Cal Newport’s <em>Deep Work </em>or other similar books, you’ll see that this program indeed shares the quality of previously researched studies (combined with the author’s and successful people's experiences) before they finally came up with the curriculum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>This teaching won’t bore you with just listening to lectures</strong></span>. The format of the teaching is visual; it recorded in high-quality videos and crystal-clear audios.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, you’re not just going to watch the lesson videos and sit around bored. Conversely, this program also includes small daily actions for you to tackle every day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>Allows you to meet and converse with other active users</strong></span>. Yup, this program has a private community to do that; it allows you to make new like-minded friends.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s nice to have a further discussion about the lesson you just had, hold accountability, and get feedback.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Is This Program for You?</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, ask yourself if you want to sharpen your personal mastery, win a big game, cultivate your potential, get rid of a bad habit, overcome a mindset that only dragging you away from the success you deserve, have better performance, and increase productivity, then this program is definitely for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, that could be undermining; the truth is this program suits literally anybody, regardless of what they want or how far they want to go; regardless of any backgrounds or professional careers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As to give you a solid proof for this matter, below I gather some of the users’ testimonials. You’ll see that they came from various backgrounds; <em>housewife, student, professional</em>; and they use this program to improve various aspects of their lives as they personally wish.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>“I am more efficient at everything. The daily practice of identifying 5 daily wins and 10 blessings at the start of my day sets the tone for a great day every day regardless of what transpires during the day.”</em></p>

<p><em>“Robin’s tactics, mindsets and habits will take your life to the next level.

<p><em>“Special Thanks to Mr. Robin Sharma to elevating my Life…</em><em>My life was absolutely out of track & feeling very un-secure & always have fear of failure. Feeling stress even doing good work. Now I even wake up at 4 am&#8230;&#8221;</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What I Say about Hero Genius Legend; My 25-Day Experience</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’d say it’s tough. Change felt like an uphill battle for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>25 days had passed, the battle is still going, but these past couple of days it’s becoming more and more convenient.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And may I remind myself again what Robin Sharma always states in the program:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #800080;"><strong><em>&#8220;Change is hard in the beginning, messy in the middle, but it's beautiful at the end&#8221;</em></strong></span></p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #800080;"><strong><em>“If it is not hard, it is not a real change”</em></strong></span><em>, </em>he added.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So… it’s 25 days down, 41 days to go, and I already feel a burden start to lift off my shoulder&#8230; slowly but surely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong><u>Here are <em>three</em> things that I’ve learned and valued from the program so far:</u></strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong><u><i class="fas fa-pen fa-lg" style="color: #dd9933"></i> The art of journaling</u></strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Journaling is not a new thing to me (maybe for you too), I have heard about it so many times but yeah, I’ve never really tried it before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’ve always thought that journaling would only add more work to do, but I was wrong. I never thought that journaling would make such a significant impact on one’s life until today.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, it is <em>not</em> just writing a journal, there’s a purpose as well as techniques on how to do that. Otherwise, it would just be like writing a diary; nothing wrong with writing down your feelings but that’s not really what we want.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re talking about journaling that can make us perform better, understand ourselves better, become more productive, more positive, and more absorbent in our learning process. These kinds of things that we will learn here in Hero Genius Legend program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, if you asked me:</p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><span style="color: #800080;">“Is there any way I could learn about this kind of journaling without firstly enrolling to the program?”</span> </em></strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>YES, there is!</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can have a <em>thorough</em> insight into how to do it by joining its <strong>FREE MASTERCLASS</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please note that it will take a bit longer (60 min-ish), BUT, I guarantee you’ll learn and benefit so much from it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And guess what’s even more beneficial from this Free Masterclass?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After joining this program, I later found out that Robin Sharma actually spilled some of its <em>paid</em> lessons quite thoroughly on this Free Masterclass! What a treat!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I started my journaling journey, and there are <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>two highlights</strong></span>:</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff6600;"><u><i class="fas fa-search fa-lg" style="color: #81d742"></i></u></span> <span style="color: #008000;">First, by journaling, I notice a change in my perspective, with which helps me to shun away my catastrophizing habit</span></strong><span style="color: #008000;">.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe some of you remember, there’s a line from the movie <em>Pretty Woman</em> that said:</p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #800080;"><strong><em>“Bad stuff is easier to believe”</em></strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I sipped it way too far.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know it sounds ridiculous, but that’s what my catastrophizing habit is about; I believed that most of the things are going to be bad. And subconsciously, I sort of made things end badly even though it could’ve been successful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sounds pretty messed-up huh?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I used to believe that this way of thinking prepared me for the worst-case scenarios. And for so long I believed it helped me survive the harsh reality and it kept me preserved from any kinds of disappointments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, I noticed that I was becoming more “toxic” rather than “prepared”. I was blasting these negative vibes over my surroundings because I was so “defensive” and pessimistic about life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What’s even worse than that?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a constant attempt to keep me away from disappointment, I lost gratitude.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And on this particular thing have <strong><span style="color: #99cc00;">I felt that Hero Genius Legend changed my perspective to see life</span>. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through the art of journaling and the practice of <em>daily gratitude</em>, I was “forced” to be grateful, even to the simplest things that I experienced each day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After 25 days, I have a deep realization that changes my perspective. <strong><span style="color: #99cc00;">I now start to believe that gratitude is more effective to keep myself from disappointments than catastrophizing ever did</span>.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I mean, if one is full of gratitude (even in their darkest time), what disappointment can possibly get them down?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, it was not easy, as I said it was an uphill battle because I have to constantly “wake myself up”; I have to be on the watch and remind myself all the time so I won’t fall back into my old habit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Robin Sharma has also stated this in one of his lessons. He stated that <strong>“willpower”</strong> is required for starters to keep pushing through (before it’s automatized) because again, change is hard at the beginning but gorgeous at the end.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And even though I haven’t reached the end of this 66-day quest, with the willpower I maintain in these 25 days, here’s a positive impact that I got:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With a more grateful heart, positivity, and the diminished of my catastrophizing habit, I have more clarity in mind, and with clarity in mind, I’m becoming more creative and productive.</p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #ff6600;"><u><i class="fas fa-search fa-lg" style="color: #81d742"></i></u></span> <span style="color: #008000;">Second</span></strong><span style="color: #008000;">, <strong>I found the best learning method that works for me!</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s called <span style="color: #99cc00;"><strong><em>deconstructing</em></strong></span>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Without spilling too much information, all I want to say is this method works well, and it is not restricted to this program alone but applicable to any other subjects you want to study out there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From now on learning new languages, reading hard philosophical books/ textbooks, implementing marketing strategies, setting priorities, making lucrative goals, even finding solutions can be more manageable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And those things mentioned can be achieved through “just” writing a journal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can it be so, you may ask?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, to know the answer you may want to let Robin Sharma explains a glimpse of this particular information himself:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before we’re going to our next point, I wanna add a little something…</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please note that this program has so many valuable personal-mastery lessons during its 66-day quest (no doubt about it), <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>however, I don’t necessarily value and follow all of them</strong></span>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my 25-day journey of joining this program, I have one lesson (day 18) that I don’t feel comfortable with. There is an idea called <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>“second wind work-out”</strong></span> and <span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong><u><i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle fa-lg" style="color: #dd3333"></i> </u></strong></span><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>I personally don’t subscribe to this and decidedly not to do that<a href="#disclaimer">*</a></strong></span>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I mean working out is good, in fact, I do the morning routine workout before journaling (Lesson day 2) but the <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>second workout? I don’t think it’s necessary since it may also lead to exhaustion</strong></span>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, I’m not saying that it is wrong to work out twice a day. That idea is good for some people e.g. athletes or people who have too much of sedentary life (which caused them obesity) but generalizing it to all can be risky.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, if you happen to enroll in this program, it would be wise for you to still be cautious with your own physical condition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alright, that’s it of my little adding, now let’s move on to the second valuable things I got from this program!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong><u><i class="fas fa-pen fa-lg" style="color: #dd9933"></i> Trained focus through simple and doable methods</u></strong></span></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Other than this pandemic, there’s another thing we’re currently facing in this 21<sup>st</sup> century…not as deadly, but quite disruptive for our self-development.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What’s that?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong>Instant gratification, which leads to a shorter attention span</strong></span>; we’re living in an era where our brains are more into something that is quick.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And if you noticed, that’s the reason why social media or internet marketing nowadays is giving you something a lot shorter than before.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What it exactly did to us?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, we got easily distracted and it becomes harder to focus on one thing in a longer period of time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may have the best learning methods but if we can’t focus, it’s nothing, right?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I personally find myself in this downward spiral too and it’s getting harder for me to even watch an hour-long YouTube video without skipping or fasten the speed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My attention span was terrible; before I got into this program, I think it’s no longer than 15 minutes and there’s a possibility that it would get even shorter if I didn’t do something. And thank goodness Hero Genius Legend has this problem covered (week 2 and 3 lessons).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So far, there are two trained-focus routines taught here that I found highly effective.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the program suggests, I do the first routine every morning (after the daily journaling) whereas the second is more flexible but I personally like to have it before bed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The practicality of these two routines is not going to get you overwhelmed at all. In fact,<span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong> these will give you more time to relax without being less productive</strong></span>. Say what?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, this program knows well that spending more time doesn’t mean you’ll get more work done.  As a matter of fact, real productivity is achieved through an undistracted focus not the quantity of time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Long story short, with these two methods to train focus installed; here is what I experience:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>I feel more satisfied and fulfilled with the work I did.</li>
<li>I finish more work in a considerably shorter period of time.</li>
<li>I feel less stress on doing the work.</li>
<li>I have a longer attention span; I’d say it’s about an hour-long now (but the number keeps growing).</li>
<li>I can finish a novel from cover to cover within a week.</li>
<li>I can have a better understanding of the book that I read.</li>
<li>I can have time to relax without feeling “guilty”.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And the last valuable thing I learned so far is:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s face it I am guilty as a person who hardly finishes things.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An instance I can think of off the top of my head is my inconsistency in learning Japanese.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I self-study Japanese a few years back (I’ve always been in love with the language) but it’s been on and off and there’s no actual result that can be seen obviously.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But this particular lesson (day 24) of Hero Genius Legend really gets me to start over and re-committed to it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Day 24 lesson gives special encouragement and challenge at the same time to me. <span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong>I’d say it’s something about how Robin Sharma delivers this principle to be persistent (even through a small daily execution) that speaks deeply into me and awaken this flame inside me</strong></span>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since then, I make a small daily action to tackle &#8216;<em>Nihongo’</em>. I wrote a schedule in my journal specifically dedicated to this: an hour each day and not memorize more than three <em>kanji</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And you won’t believe how much I actually learned more in this one-hour studying (with no more than 3 <em>kanji</em> memorized) <span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong>consistently every single day</strong></span>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong><u><i class="fas fa-pen fa-lg" style="color: #dd9933"></i> So</u><span style="text-decoration: underline;">, that’s it for my testimonial</span></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">, </span></span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff6600; text-decoration: underline;">to conclude</span></span>;</strong> I’m happy with how this program helps me develop myself for the better. Despite the truth that I was quite skeptical of this program at first, now it turns out I have nothing against it<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><a href="#disclaimer">*</a></strong></span>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I still have 41 days to go, and from what I can see here, <span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong>the further the lesson, the more valuable it gets</strong></span>. I mean, Hero Genius Legend has lessons on <span style="color: #ff9900;"><em>Mental Mastery, Be OK with Being Different, Beating Procrastination, </em>and <em>Practices of Global Influencer! </em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How’s that sound? I myself can’t wait for those upcoming lessons!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In case you also have the urge to have a new beginning in life; to transform your life from your past self to the better version of you are… it’s never too late. All you need to do is just taking an action.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No, you don’t have to buy this program right away, but you can start a small action by attending <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://buythiz.com/goherolegendfree" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Hero Genius Legend FREE MASTERCLASS</strong></a></span></span> then decide afterward.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, if you feel pretty convinced already, here’s:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this final section, you’ll remove your final barrier and shine up your mental armor. This is where you take the leap into owning your craft and dominating your industry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>This section highlights:</strong></p>

<li>Practicing 5 tactics of global influencers</li>
<li>How to be a hero</li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Conclusion and Final Verdict</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After 25 days partaken in this program, <strong>I’ve noticed great deal of improvements not just in an increased level of my productivity but also in my being and my perspective in life<span style="color: #ff6600;"><a style="color: #ff6600;" href="#disclaimer">*</a></span>.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hence, with such experience, I must say that <span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>this program is definitely <em>not</em> trash; Hero Genius Legend program works well for me!</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’ll certainly continue and finish this 66-day quest!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And with the same <strong>willpower</strong> to follow through this program’s quest, <strong>I strongly believe it will also work for everyone else<span style="color: #ff0000;"><a href="#disclaimer">*</a></span>.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if you think you need an immediate change from a “messed-up situation” and have the commitment to do that, <strong>I totally recommend this program for you!</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other than the fact that this program does help, I also have other reasoning why this program deserves a try (I can't seem to emphasize this enough):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>It has <span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>high-quality lesson materials</strong>,</span> it’s no surprise that every Mindvalley’s program has high quality and Hero Genius Legend is no different. In the video as well as the audio, everything is crystal-clear.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>I like <span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>the compactness</strong></span> of this program. The daily lesson won’t require me more than 10 minutes (without missing its point). For people who suffer from a short attention span, this kind of teaching is our first aid.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>It gives us time to chew and swallow</strong></span>. My personal favorite when it comes to Mindvalley’s program is its format to give users a “bite-sized” lesson each day so they won’t get overwhelmed.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>This is a science-based program</strong></span>. And by science I mean it’s made under the consideration of clinical research in the field of human psychology and neuroscience; nothing pseudo here.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>PLUS</strong></span> this scientific-based is also <span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>collaborated with the author’s coaching experience for over two decades</strong></span> amongst impactful world’s figures and organizations and it’s been proven to work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>Community group available</strong></span>, it’s always nice to have like-minded people, get feedback, and greater accountability.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="”disclaimer”"></a></p>
<ul>
<li>To make it more convenient for every potential customer, this program has the availability of a <span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>15-day money-back guarantee</strong></span>. In case you didn’t meet your expected results with this program, you can ask for your money back.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But since there’s also a chance that you may like this program, why not give it a go first?</p>

<p><span style="color: #20b2aa;"><em>And ooh boy, was I hooked by the promise. </em></span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">How could I not be? The video says that as a woman, I can “eat as many as I want without gaining weight/fat” </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">It also implies that women biologically have the upper hand in terms of <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://buythiz.com/review/the-underground-fat-loss-manual-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener">losing fat</a></span>/weight. <span style="color: #20b2aa;">But I cared more about the eating as many as I want. </span></span><span style="color: #20b2aa;"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">As someone who gains weight rather easily, I naturally jumped at the chance to be one of those women with high metabolism.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Then I got myself the 12-week program <span style="color: #ff8243;"><strong>which I tried for a full month and now I give you my Venus Factor review</strong>.</span></span><span style="color: #ff9933;" data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p>And although I get commissions for purchases made through links in this page as An Affiliate.</p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Don't worry, <strong><span style="color: #20b2aa;">I'm gonna be really honest here</span></strong>. Unlike some mediocre reviews out there.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">I'm not talking about reviews from real people who really tried the program, I'm talking about the <span style="color: #6495ed;"><span style="color: #20b2aa;"><span style="color: #000000;"><i class="far fa-thumbs-down fa-lg" style="color: #d40000"></i></span></span></span> <em><span style="color: #d40000;">almost robotic, money-oriented, no personal experience</span></em> Venus Factor reviews that you see a lot when you go online.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">But I'm getting ahead of myself. I'll talk more about that later. First, let’s go through the program.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Basically, Venus Factor is a <i class="fas fa-calendar-alt fa-lg" style="color: #f77f00"></i> <span style="color: #1e90ff;"><span style="color: #6495ed;"><strong>weight-loss program in 3 months</strong></span>.</span> If you don’t want to, you don’t have to exercise although the program </span><span data-contrast="auto">recommends</span><span data-contrast="auto"> you to. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Nutrition and diet play an important role in every fitness journey.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">The program realizes that some people simply want to lose weight without gaining muscle, so it gives that option.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The book mentions that when we’re doing the Venus Diet, <span style="color: #1e90ff;"><span style="color: #6495ed;"><strong>the key is balance</strong></span>.</span> There’s no bad and good food, everything should be in moderation and balanced.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> <i class="fas fa-balance-scale fa-lg" style="color: #f77f00"></i></span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Which makes it a good thing for us who want to lose weight but not chained to restrictions and cutbacks.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">What's more, John Barban the author specifically designed this program for women. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #6495ed;">Guys can be at or below 10% body fat and still look healthy and lean. Gals, on the other hand, will look sickly in this number. </span></p>

<h5>Podcast</h5>
<p>In honesty, I didn't access the podcast at all. I don't think there's any podcast to listen to in the first place.</p>
<p>To my knowledge, the podcast is there to let us hear weight loss success stories from women who joined Venus Factor transformation contests and win.</p>
<p>Yes, there are contests. The book says that annually, they host three transformation contests.</p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">When I counted, my daily exercise time is about 45 &#8211; 50 minutes (I don’t work out every day). But, there’s no option for that.

<p><strong><span style="color: #20b2aa;" data-contrast="auto">I wish there was an option for that, but no. </span></strong><span data-contrast="auto">So</span><span data-contrast="auto"> I chose 0.5 because in truth I don’t workout daily for one hour.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Looking at the numbers they gave me, I agree that my waist should be smaller. I realize that I’ve still got some fat around it.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Then I figured if I should just train my shoulders <i class="fas fa-dumbbell fa-lg" style="color: #f77f00"></i> every time I work out. <span style="color: #20b2aa;">I decided to try that and see</span>.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">This could be because of the limited activity (exercise time) input in the Venus Factor VN or due to the program itself.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">As you can see, my weight dropped 1.3kg (2.87 pounds). Before, my weight was 50.6kg and it went to 49.3kg. </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">My shoulders grew too! <i class="fas fa-dumbbell fa-lg" style="color: #f77f00"></i> All thanks to shoulder exercises in every workout </span><span data-contrast="auto">sesh</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Apparently despite the surplus last week, I still lost some weight.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Before going to week 2, I decided to try 16/8 intermittent fasting (IF) + calorie deficit.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto"><span style="color: #20b2aa;">Without a window, I thought that I wouldn’t be able to hold myself from snacking</span>. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">It's not much compared to people who fast longer, of course. But anyways, it worked for me. I managed to eat only 1000 cals for five days.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Yeah, I know, I cheated again.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">My body was used to eating less calories by this point, <span style="color: #20b2aa;">I didn’t get hunger headaches anymore</span>. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">This week, I found that I got so drowsy during the day. I drank coffee, but didn’t help much. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Also, I found my pompholyx appearing more frequently, to areas that it hadn’t touched before (my fingers, soles of feet, right calf).</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Maybe it was because of the diet, maybe not. I'm not sure either.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Moreover, I felt my joints popping more than before. <span style="color: #20b2aa;"><em>Though it could be that I only noticed it now</em></span>.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Because of that, I thought I was a bit lacking in calcium in these two weeks. I drank a full mug of milk.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto"><strong><span style="color: #20b2aa;">Bad idea</span></strong>. I'm a bit lactose intolerant.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">So</span><span data-contrast="auto"> if you’re like me, <span style="color: #ff8243;">just get a supplement or eat calcium-rich food like almonds</span>. Or you know, almond milk.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

I don't think my waist shrunk 2 inches. I only realized it now, sorry.</p></div>
<p></a></span></p>
<p>Thankfully I didn't get any headaches, but I did get hungry.</p>
<p>Maybe what I felt was not exactly hunger. I was on period, so I kinda craved some types of food. Primarily sweet stuff. <span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"><i class="fas fa-cookie-bite fa-lg" style="color: #a0522d"></i></span></p>
<p>I managed to stay on deficit, although there was a day where I almost lost control. I ate about a little more over 1100 calories. <span style="color: #20b2aa;"><em>Whoops </em><span style="color: #000000;"><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"><i class="far fa-grin-beam-sweat fa-lg" style="color: #f77f00"></i></span></span></span></p>
<p>To tell the truth, <span style="color: #20b2aa;">I got another palpitation when I was doing HIIT on Saturday</span>. I was fine doing this type of cardio before (after the 1st palpitation).</p>
<p>Perhaps the cause was that I only had coffee after I woke up then I'd swept and mopped the floor before I worked out. I don't know if it's fatigue or lack of nutrition or caffeine.</p>
<p>In any case, if we share the same condition, <span style="color: #f77f00;"><strong>be mindful of your body when you're doing the Venus Factor</strong></span>. Don't be like me! <span style="color: #20b2aa;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"><i class="far fa-laugh-wink fa-lg" style="color: #f77f00"></i></span></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Result?</h4>
<p>Soo, after a full month of doing the Venus Diet, <span style="color: #20b2aa;"><strong>I lost 1.1kg (2.43 pounds)</strong></span><a href="#disclaimer">*</a>. It's not much, but remember that I ate more than my deficit number numerous times.</p>

<p>Based on the photo comparison above, I don't think I changed a lot.</p>
<p>Perhaps it's due to the fact that I only lost a kilogram. I didn't have that chiseled look; there's still some fat around my waist as well.</p>
<p>Though I could feel that my shoulders are a tad bigger, which I like. And, I can see a little reduction of back fold/roll when I bend my waist.</p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">But according to its calculation, I think my deficit was a bit too much. If it were only IF with VF maintenance, I wouldn’t mind.

<p>What's more, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3943438/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this 2014 review</a></span></span> says that athletes should go with slow rate of weight loss.</p>
<p>I'm no athlete, but I think if you've got healthy range body fat content or BMI, the Venus Factor may not be the best fat loss program.</p>
<p><span style="color: #20b2aa;">If you’ve got more body fat percentage, I think you can still slowly increase your metabolism while shedding some fat mass.  </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">We can get to that stage by eating healthy food and doing some resistance training.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<h4>Resistance/strength training vs cardio</h4>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In my opinion, I'd rather increase my muscle mass and <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://buythiz.com/wake-up-lean-meredith-shirk-lp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increase my metabolism</a></span> than cutting.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Of course</span><span data-contrast="auto"> everyone’s different.

<p>I understand that there's still a debate between resistance/strength training vs cardio. I found <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ejcn2014216" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a scientific review</a></span> saying that the average BMR increase after 9 months of RT is 5%.</p>
<p>In fact, the review I highlighted says that <span style="color: #f77f00;"><em>strength training improves bone density, self-esteem, decreases symptoms of depression, and reverse aging factors in skeletal muscle</em></span>.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, I don't hate cardio. I like doing HIIT. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://journals.lww.com/acsm-msse/Fulltext/2019/06001/Effects_Of_Intermittent_Fasting_And_High_Intensity.977.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This study</a></span> suggests that IF + HIIT is a good combination.</p>
<p>Therefore, if you're more of a cardio person, just keep doing it! <span data-contrast="auto"><span style="color: #6495ed;"><span style="color: #20b2aa;"><span style="color: #000000;"><i class="far fa-grin-beam fa-lg" style="color: #f77f00"></i></span></span></span></span></p>

<li>For me, Venus Factor is quite complete. As I said, it’s got the recipes, community, as well as workout how-<span data-contrast="auto">tos</span><span data-contrast="auto"> and plan.<br />
&nbsp<br />
</span></li>
<li>The <strong><span style="color: #20b2aa;">flexibility</span> </strong>of this program is something I like too. <span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"><br />

&nbsp<br />
</span><span style="color: #ff9933;"><strong>The truth is that we still need to be on a diet, on calorie deficit first</strong></span>.

&nbsp<br />
</span></li>
<li><span data-contrast="auto">Speaking about Venus Factor’s maintenance calories, <span style="color: #20b2aa;">I think its calculator is super outdated</span>.

&nbsp<br />
</span>John Barban says that the program doesn’t want us to crash diet. But thanks to the outdated calculator, <span style="color: #20b2aa;">I ended up crash dieting anyway</span>.<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"><br />

</span></li>
<li><span data-contrast="auto"><span style="color: #20b2aa;"><strong>So many bogus Venus Factor reviews.</strong> </span>The titles claim to be honest and real, but they’re just pretending. <span style="color: #6495ed;"><span style="color: #20b2aa;"><span style="color: #000000;"><i class="far fa-times-circle fa-lg" style="color: #d40000"></i> </span></span></span><span style="color: #ff8243;">Many only try to make you buy the program</span>.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"><br />

</span>Now, I realize that it's not the program's fault. But, for those who are trying to find a diet program (and look for reviews), it can be misleading.<br />

<h4>What to get</h4>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">First and foremost, you need to get some stuff, particularly if you’re new to the fitness journey. </span></p>
<p>You need to get a calorie tracker. The easiest are apps like <span data-contrast="auto">FatSecret</span><span data-contrast="auto"> or MyFitnessPal. You also need a <i class="fas fa-tape fa-lg" style="color: #f77f00"></i> measuring tape.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><i class="far fa-hand-point-up fa-lg" style="color: #f77f00"></i> </span>Oh<span data-contrast="auto"> by the way, Venus Factor doesn’t include the calories out from working out. During the program, <span style="color: #6495ed;">only log your food</span>.</span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">Leave about 30-50 calories for uncertainty stuff.</span></p>
<p>Additional calipers can be useful too. It's not precise in terms of measuring body fat percentage, but it can help.</p>
<p>For newbies who haven’t got home equipment, <span style="color: #20b2aa;">just go online and find beginner bodyweight workout routines</span>.</p>
<p>The ones from Venus Factor need some equipment like a gym ball and dumbbells. And, it involves push-ups on the very first routine.</p>
<p>Newbies who don’t know how to modify some exercises can find VF exercises difficult.</p>
<p>If you’ve got the analog food and body weight scale, that’s fine. It's just that the digital can be more accurate.</p>
<p>Food scale is really important, IMO. Because if you don’t have it, <span style="color: #20b2aa;"><strong>you’ll either overestimate or underestimate your food intake</strong></span>. Both are not good.<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"><br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>What to eat</h4>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Second, <strong><span style="color: #ff8243;">eat healthy, nutrient-rich food</span></strong>. Otherwise, you’re gonna get hungry more easily. </span></p>
<p>I’m pretty sure I can manage 1000 calories a day without getting hungry. It's just that <i class="fas fa-hotdog fa-lg" style="color: #d40000"></i> <span style="color: #20b2aa;">what I ate were “bad”</span>. As a result, I needed to hold my hunger.</p>
<p>How did I do that? Made myself as busy as possible. I sang, played, did the chores, anything to make my not think of food.</p>
<p>Moreover, <span style="color: #6495ed;">Venus Factor says that the eat-up days shouldn’t be two consecutive days.</span> It may be hard for us to get back to deficit days.</p>
<p>But, I could do it. It may be better if you don’t do what I did, but what I'm saying is that <span style="color: #20b2aa;"><em>if you can’t do separate maintenance days, it’s fine.</em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Friendly reminder</h4>
<p>Thirdly, if you've decided to do the program and you've never been on a lot of deficit before, <strong><span style="color: #20b2aa;">it's gonna be tough</span></strong><span style="color: #20b2aa;">.</span></p>
<p>I dealt with headaches in the first week, remember? But it went away on its own, our bodies can adapt.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, <span style="color: #20b2aa;">if you can't deal with it, it's okay to cut yourself some slack</span>.</p>
<p>And, utilize that community page and/or be active there. It's really great for supports, motivation talks, questions, and many things.</p>
<p>While I didn't post anything there, I suggest you do <span data-contrast="auto"><i class="far fa-smile-beam fa-lg" style="color: #f77f00"></i> </span></p>

<h2>Who shouldn't do this program?</h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto"><span style="color: #20b2aa;"><strong>Men.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Surely the Venus Factor would say that all women can do the program. </span><span data-contrast="auto">But,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> I think there are a few exceptions. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff8243;">If you have an active job(s), haven’t tried fasting/dieting at all, and completely new to calorie deficit, it’s gonna be challenging. </span></p>

<p><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">Well, <span style="color: #20b2aa;"><strong>in terms of weight loss, the Venus Factor works</strong></span><a href="#disclaimer">*</a>. Not the result I'd expected, though. </span></p>
<p>My calorie intake exceeded 1000 calories on most days over the course of this program, but I managed to lose weight anyway.</p>
<p>I still have a long way to be like women who can eat as many food as I want without getting fat.</p>
<p>But yeah, <span style="color: #20b2aa;"><em>I could finally reach under 50kg with the Venus Diet</em></span>, I'll give 'em that.</p>
<p>So, if you're looking to lose some weight, John Barban's program may be <span style="color: #20b2aa;"><strong>worth a try</strong></span>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Some things I should mention</h4>
<p>Venus Factor is a <strong><span style="color: #20b2aa;">12-week program which I did only for 4 weeks</span></strong>. As a result, I couldn't do the exact diet protocol (like 2 week high-fat, 2 week high-protein etc).</p>
<p>Basically, I treated it like a regular calorie deficit diet. Let's just say this is my &#8220;limitation of the review&#8221; <span data-contrast="auto"><span style="color: #6495ed;"><span style="color: #20b2aa;"><span style="color: #000000;"><i class="far fa-grin-wink fa-lg" style="color: #f77f00"></i></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>So maybe, I could be like what John Barban promises. But since I did the program for only a month, this whole thing is kinda meh for me.</p>
<p><span style="color: #20b2aa;"><span style="color: #6495ed;"><span style="color: #000000;"><i class="far fa-hand-point-up fa-lg" style="color: #f77f00"></i> </span></span><em>That said, what didn't work for me may work well for someone who did it for 3 months.</em></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><strong>Metabolic Stretching Review</strong> &#8211; Lately, I felt so unenergetic because I stayed at home way too long. All I did was just eat, work, and sleep. Turned out this habit got me sick easily. So, I decided to change my habit in this new year for the sake of my healthiness.</span></p>
<p>Then, I stumbled upon a home exercise called <span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong>Metabolic Stretching</strong></span> that helps people lose weight. The thing was that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I didn't want to lose weight, in fact, I'm too skinny to lose another pound</span>. But, this program is so tempting. It only takes about 15-minute a day and no hard equipment needed, except a yoga mat.</p>
<p>Moreover, the exercise would be regular stretching which I believed I could take on this program consistently.</p>
<p>I decided to try for 3-week and boom! I couldn't believe what the program had helped me throughout the days. So, here I'll share my full experience with you how <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://buythiz.com/gometabolicstretch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metabolic Stretching</a></strong></span> works out for me.</p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Metabolic stretching is an online exercise training to help people lose weight and live a healthy lifestyle. This online program requires a daily 15-minute video training from beginner to advance. Thus, making it feasible for a different type of audience.</span></p>
<p>This exercise is regarded as dynamic stretching where you're moving your body and your muscle are being stretched. Unlike static stretching, you don't need to pull your muscle to stretch and hold it for about 10 seconds or more. Metabolic stretching is common to apply before partaking in next-level fitness exercise, however, it can also be used as a standalone exercise to lose weight.</p>
<p>You don't need any equipment to start this program. But, if you have a yoga mat, it'd be much better as it reduces the risk of muscle injury.</p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In addition, this home exercise narrows down the biggest lie that the weight-loss industry has planted into our minds. These lies are the main reason why most people choose the wrong path to lose weight. Here are some examples that Metabolic Stretching has concluded:</span></p>
<p><strong>Heavy Diet</strong></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The thing about this heavy diet is that the audience is asked to starve themselves to death (not literally). The creators will provide them a strict rule on what to eat or not, which sometimes becomes a backlash since every person's need varies from each other.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This scheme results in a <span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong>YO-YO state</strong></span>. It is a condition when a person loses weight in a short time. But then, gain weight later on. It's not a steady practice as it gives the outcome temporary.   </span></p>
<p><strong>High-Intensity Exercise</strong></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">There's this myth in which the more you train, the fastest it is for you to lose weight. It never works that way. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The fitness industry made you believe a specific amount of high-intensity training helps you achieve your goal faster. On the other hand, it only drains you a lot; that you start to forget the healthy process.</span></p>
<p><strong>Hours of Cardio Training</strong></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">You may disagree with a statement that hours of cardio won't give you justice; </span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">much</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">. People believe that cardio training such as jogging, treadmill, and cross-trainer can help you lose weight fast.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">But, it requires time to do that on weekly basis. It's not something apt for busy people. You have to dedicate a lot of time to practice this. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">That's why it is one of the greatest pitfalls. People usually stop practicing in the middle as they get busier day by day.  </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Metabolic stretching has two main lessons that are apt for both novice and experienced users. It also provides a free bonus inside the download page. So, let's dive into this training.</span></p>
<p><strong>Instruction Video</strong></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Available for:<br />
</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong>Beginner</strong></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong>Advanced</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Just like its name, before diving into real video training, the instruction video allows the viewers to practice a particular movement. The beginner one, for example, enables you to run a simple technique like a simple breathing technique, step jack, standing bicycle, and many more.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">You will also learn diaphragm breathing, 90 90 flow, seal jack, kickboxer's block, and so on in the advanced video.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The instructional video allows you to prepare yourself before getting into the program. It also lets you understand the purpose of each technique.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">So you've tried many things to lose weight, but you failed miserably. Or you want to start a healthy lifestyle with a minimum amount of time. Then, Metabolic Stretching is best for you.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">I find that there are some reasons why you need to give this program a try.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong>First, you want to lose weight.</strong></span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Honestly, there are tons of weight-loss programs on the internet. They range from a strict diet to heavy exercise that burnt you out in a short time. Although there may be a viable training that meets your needs, the result isn't satisfying enough. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong>Second, you want to tone up your body.</strong></span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">If you think, the only way to getting packed is striving for a heavy workout; then you need to think twice. When you're not ready, the training will drain you out. And instead of getting your dream body, you will face the counterpart.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong>Third, you want to start exercising but have no time for it.</strong></span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The common myth about exercising is you need dedication for it. Well, that ain't wrong for that matter. However, you are that hardworking youngster who has no time to exercise. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Or you have some excuses for that. But, it's still understandable, </span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">really</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">So if you say yes to any of the statements above, then you should try Metabolic Stretching for once in your life. You'd be super stocked to what the result is.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">First and foremost, the program claims a bold statement that the users can get the result as short as just 14-day. However, there's no further information on how many times I should do it on a weekly basis.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Therefore, I tried contacting customer support for help. And here's the answer:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Mon &#8211; Met Stretch beginner routine</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Tues &#8211; Off day &#8211; active recovery (walking, biking, jogging, etc)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Wed &#8211; Met Stretch beginner routine</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Thurs &#8211; Off day &#8211; active recovery (same)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Fri &#8211; Met Stretch beginner routine</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Sat & Sun &#8211; Off day &#8211; active recovery (same)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">And then, you can progress to doing this routine on a daily basis.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Alright&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">I did the same thing for the first week; however, I did some customization for the following two weeks.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The simple reason is that I was bored. I thought that the beginner video is a bit too easy for me; thus, I challenge myself to mix it with the advanced one.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Here's me doing a beginner movement:</span></p>
<div id="v-rYwBjkn2-1" class="video-player"><video id="v-rYwBjkn2-1-video" width="840" height="630" poster="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/rYwBjkn2/metabolic-stretching-example-1_dvd.original.jpg" controls="true" preload="metadata" dir="ltr" lang="en"><source src="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/rYwBjkn2/metabolic-stretching-example-1_dvd.mp4" type="video/mp4; codecs=&quot;avc1.64001E, mp4a.40.2&quot;" /><source src="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/rYwBjkn2/metabolic-stretching-example-1_fmt1.ogv" type="video/ogg; codecs=&quot;theora, vorbis&quot;" /><div><img alt="" src="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/rYwBjkn2/metabolic-stretching-example-1_dvd.original.jpg" width="840" height="630" /></div></video></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">So, yeah&#8230; both the beginner and advanced training will sweat you a lot. It means that the workout works, you know what I mean.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">I didn't feel too exhausted while doing the exercise. Well, I did it honestly for the first time having it. But when you are used to it, the fatigue is manageable. It's like having a normal workout outdoor.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">But, there's something I didn't expect to happen. I lost a little bit of weight, lol. Although it's not something I hope for, it did happen for a skinny girl like me.<a href="#disclaimer">*</a> </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">So, <strong><span style="color: #ff9900;">I lost weight from 49.2kg to 48.8kg within 3 weeks.</span> </strong>Please also note that I don't even practice a diet menu, etc. Since I live in a Southeast Asian country, I find it difficult to omit our signature rice on our dish. However, I do feel fresh after the routine exercise using the Metabolic Stretching program.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">But, if you aim for weight-loss, you may consider incorporating a significant diet menu while doing Metabolic Stretching. I suggest it will give you the best result.</span></p>
<p>And, how about the fatigue I felt before partaking in the program? Well, I feel better now. I'm feeling fresh after consistently follow the program. So, yeah&#8230; <strong><span style="color: #ff9900;">finally I've got my energy back.</span></strong></p>

<h3><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Final Verdict</span></h3>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Metabolic Stretching is an excellent program for novice and experienced bodybuilders. The step-by-step guidelines allow the novice viewers to get a grasp of this program thoroughly. And, for the latter simply enhance their previous skills to get the most of it.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">First off, I consider myself a beginner. I'm not into fitness or something related to that. Not that I hate exercising, I prefer cardio-based exercise like aerobic or outdoor sports like swimming and hiking. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">But, I feel that this Metabolic Stretching has helped me get into exercise nowadays when the pandemic forces us to stay at home. The program is obviously helpful for any type of audience including rookies like me.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Compared to the <a href="https://buythiz.com/review/yoga-burn-challenge-zoe-bray-cotton-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Yoga Burn</span></strong></a> Training that I have tried before, I find Metabolic Stretching is easier to follow. I have almost no hard time to track every movement inside the program. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Although I'm a super beginner, that doesn't stop me to train myself with the advanced program. I still find it easy to understand. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The only pitfall may be the lack of information on how many times I should do the exercise. Since it claimed to have a quick result in just 14-day. It's a bold statement, tho. However, this program is straightforward. You don't need significant equipment to start the exercise. But, it'd be better if you have a yoga mat to make your exercise experience easier. Metabolic Stretching is feasible for both beginner and advanced students. The instruction video will help you understand before starting the follow-along routine. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Personally, my objection was never going to lose weight. I'm skinny in the first place, so I just need exercise to help me start a healthy lifestyle.</span><br />
<a name="disclaimer"></a></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Overall, I'm deeply satisfied with this program; and I definitely will continue in the long run.</span></p>

<h3><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Disclaimer</span></h3>

It's best to consult with your physician before starting the program. Also, the result may vary for each person due to the initial condition and the intensity of the training.</span></p>

During one of our conversations, he asked me something weird but true.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #008000;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #333399;"><i class="fas fa-search fa-lg" style="color: #996633"></i> </span></span>“So, now you own a cat?” he asked.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indeed, after I got married, my wife’s cat is now living together with us. But what’s weird about the question was how did he find it out?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I asked about how could he find out, since that time my cat was roaming around outside and I put all of his equipment in the other room.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #016c7a;"><strong><span style="color: #008000;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #333399;"><i class="fas fa-search fa-lg" style="color: #dd1111"></i> </span></span></span></strong></span><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>He said, “I can recognize the smell of a cat owner.”</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At first, I laughed. But when I asked him to elaborate his statement, he said that the smell of cat urine is so specific and almost every single cat owner’s house will smell like it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #008000;"><span style="color: #333399;"><i class="fas fa-heart fa-lg" style="color: #d3d155"></i> </span></span>I realized that he was right, my house indeed has the lingering smell of Mayo’s (my wife’s cat) urine.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He is a nice cat and loves to cuddle. But the problem with his behavior is that he still loves to cat spray in my house. I gave him a nice litterbox, but somehow, he seems like doesn’t like it a lot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During that conversation, I asked my friend, who is also a parent of 7 cats, about how to solve this problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #008000;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #333399;"><i class="fas fa-check fa-lg" style="color: #ee1234"></i> </span></span>He recommended Cat Spraying No More by Sarah Richard to me.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here, I will tell you about my own experience of teaching Mayo how to pee in litterbox and stop cat spraying all around my house with the guidance <a href="https://buythiz.com/gocatspraynomore" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Cat Spraying No More by Sarah Richard</strong></span></span></a> gives me.</p>

<p><a href="https://buythiz.com/gocatspraynomore" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Cat Spraying No More by Sarah Richard</strong></span></span></a> is a program designed to help cat owners in stopping their cats pee or spray outside their litter box <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>PERMANENTLY.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><span style="color: #008000;"><span style="color: #333399;"><i class="fas fa-heart fa-lg" style="color: #d3d155"></i> </span></span></strong><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>It includes explanations about how to work out why cats are peeing in the house,</strong></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many people who own cats scream at their cats or even punish them bad because they are peeing or spraying outside their litter box.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Including me, when Mayo was peeing in our laundry box. I punished him by throwing him outside and screamed at him angrily.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #003300;"><span style="color: #008000;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #333399;"><i class="fas fa-check fa-lg" style="color: #1234ee"></i></span></span></span></span><span style="color: #008000;"> <span style="color: #ff0000;">It didn’t stop him to repeat the action, since several days later he did it again.</span></span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I thought that the place where I put our laundry box is his favorite place, thus I decided to put his litter box there. And it was a success at first.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, about two weeks later, he continued to pee in other places again such as in my chair, our bedroom, even on the stove in my kitchen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, because I thought that was a cat’s natural behavior, I didn’t think about it anymore and only responded (scolded) our cat when he did something wrong.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #008064;"><span style="color: #000080;"><span style="color: #008000;"><span style="color: #333399;"><i class="fas fa-bomb fa-lg" style="color: #d33333"></i> </span></span></span></span><span style="color: #008080;">It was until my friend said he noticed the smell of cat urine in my house.</span></strong></p>

<h3>But Why Cats Pee In The House Inappropriately?</h3>

<p>According to <a href="https://kb.rspca.org.au/knowledge-base/why-is-my-cat-urinating-inappropriately/#:~:text=Frustration%2C%20stress%2C%20or%20anxiety%20can,means%20of%20marking%20their%20territory." target="_blank" rel="noopener">RSPCA</a>, there are several reasons why cats urinate inappropriately and it is a common issue among cat owners.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First reason is medical causes, such as diseases of urinary tract. Our cats are also vulnerable to diseases such as bladder stones, bacterial infections, old age, and other inflammatory diseases that increased urgency of urination.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second reason is behavioral. Cats may sometimes change their urinating habits because of physiological aspects such as frustration, stress, and anxiety. There are several triggers for it, and I thought this is the reason for Mayo’s behavior.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another reason for cat spraying is to mark their territory. Cats are very territorial creatures, and as any other territorial creatures, they mark their territory. In addition to that, cats love to smell their own familiar smells.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #008000;"><span style="color: #333399;"><span style="color: #000080;"><i class="fas fa-align-right fa-lg" style="color: #eeee33"></i></span> </span>Knowing why your cats are urinating inappropriately is important for preventing it doing the bad behavior.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My first impression of <a href="https://buythiz.com/gocatspraynomore" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Cat Spraying No More by Sarah Richard</strong></span></span></a> was that it provides complete step-by-step guides to understand what is the reason for your cat’s behavior.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong><span style="color: #008000;"><span style="color: #333399;"><i class="fas fa-coffee fa-lg" style="color: #d33333"></i> </span></span></strong><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>It even dedicated one full chapter on becoming a cat detective!</strong></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I mentioned above, Mayo’s behavior is more likely caused by anxiety in new environment after my wife brought him to live in my house.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, I discovered the cause for Mayo’s behavior. But how to stop him causing in his new environment? That’s another chapter of the book.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The program offers step-by-step solution to stop your cat urinating inappropriately that’s divided into 11 chapters from introduction to conclusion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #800080;"><span style="color: #000080;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #008000;"><span style="color: #333399;"><i class="fas fa-caret-right fa-lg" style="color: #dd3333"></i> </span></span></span></span><span style="color: #002f80;">Here is one-by-one explanation about each chapter:</span></span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff2600; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Introduction: </strong></span></span>Talking about the introduction of a program, you might think that this is just a boring part of the book where the author is talking a lot of small talks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, this program doesn’t have that kind of introduction. Instead, it briefly explains about cat’s biology and behavior that lead to the problem we are talking about.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This part includes explanations about why cat urine smells that way, the bad habits of cats, the causes, also cat personality based on the environment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff2600;"><strong>Becoming A Cat Detective: </strong></span>This is where our works to eliminate the problem starts. This chapter explains how to find out what’s the real cause of their inappropriate urination.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It includes many aspects to be investigated such as their personal preference, physical inability, medical issues, traumas, stress, dominant behavior, and of course marking territories.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This chapter specifically helped me to investigate Mayo’s behaviors and thus I discovered that moving in into a new environment has caused his inappropriate urination.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff2600;"><strong>Getting Your Cat Use A Litter Box – The Basic Approach: </strong></span>This is hands down the most complete guide I have ever read on how to make your cats urinate in their litter box from the basics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Understanding this chapter will you to be able to prevent future disasters when your cats are having children or when you are adopting a new member of the family.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It includes guides to make the litter box preferable for your cats starting from its positioning, features, the ratio of the box, and how to clean it so they will more likely to enjoy it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff2600;"><strong>Cats And Stress: Causes And Fixes: </strong></span>If your cat is urinating inappropriately because of physiological reasons, then you might find the answer to it in this chapter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The thing is, this chapter explains that our behavior also affects their behaviors. This is something new to me, because I never thought so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The thing with this chapter is that helping our cats’ behavior might require us to change our behavior toward them too. One of the examples is to stop yelling at them. That’s not how it works.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff2600;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Locating The Offender:</span> </strong></span>Do you think that our houses are clean? Well, the fact is, our house is never totally clean when we have a cat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cat’s urine has special chemical compound that makes it still noticeable for them even though we have cleaned it until we think it is clean.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The presence of this invisible cat urine triggers specific behavior to cats. This chapter will help us to locate it in our house, and how to get rid of it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff2600; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Using Medication To Resolve Issues: </strong></span></span>This chapter contains a short explanation about whether or not medication is always needed for your cat’s issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff2600;"><strong>Real-World Example Of Success: </strong></span>In this part, Sarah Richard wrote the story of her cat Timmy, and how she finally found a way to solve Timmy’s inappropriate behavior.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff2600;"><strong>Detailed Techniques For Preventing Inappropriate Elimination: </strong></span>While in previous chapters the author has explained how to do the basics, here we will get more detailed information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It covers everything starting from daily routine, cleansing, familiar objects, litter box placement, reinforcement, also herbal remedies and neutering.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And as the title said that this chapter talks about detailed techniques, a lot of things explained in previous chapters will be explained better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In example, this chapter talks about how to clean your house thoroughly in any surface, so that your cats won’t urinate there anymore because of the familiar smell.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong><span style="color: #ff2600;">Natural And Herbal Remedies:</span> </strong></span>Instead of using chemicals to solve your problems, especially if your cats are having specific medical conditions, you can use natural and herbal remedies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This chapter will also explain a lot of information about which plants can help us to stop our cats urinating inappropriately, by attracting them to litter their litter boxes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact, there are many plants that we can use and we can find them easily around our house. I also practiced one of the techniques explained in this chapter to attract Mayo’s attention to his litter box.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff6600; text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #ff2600; text-decoration: underline;">Conclusion:</span> </strong></span></span>Well, just like any other conclusions in other programs, this is where the author put her final thought and verdict of this program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on my explanation about the contents of the book above, you should have realized that this program is talking about cat spraying thoroughly starting from the causes to the aftermath.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sarah Richard is Veterinary Technician for the SPCA (Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just like us, the creator of this book Sarah Richard had to cope with her cat, Timmy, because they were cat spraying all over her house.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She decided to find an effective solution for this problem, but using no harmful methods for her beloved cats by conducting simple researches about the behavior of cats.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After trying out several methods she discovered, she navigated to find the best ones for her cats, and for her too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But among those best, some were not preferable for her and her cats, because it either included aggressive repellents, unnatural, or too complicated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>She compiled all the information into a program entitled Cat Spraying No More.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Her program includes methods that are based on positive rewards, natural barriers, no aggressive repellants, easy to understand, and eventually will increase the bond between cats and their owners.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, thousand cat owners are thankful for her dedication to compile this program. But am I one of those cat owners? I will tell you my own experience later.</p>

<h3>How Does It Work? My Own Testimonial</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the initial purchase, it has been a month for me and Mayo working on this program. The first effect could be seen since the last change I made to his litter box.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thus, even though the effect occurred gradually, it has been two whole weeks since Mayo did his bad habit in my house. But how could this program work for him?</p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #000080;"><span style="color: #008000;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #333399;"><i class="fas fa-align-right fa-lg" style="color: #33ddbb"></i> </span></span></span>Let’s talk about how the program worked for Mayo.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since Mayo’s behavior changed after he moved in to my house because of our marriage, me and my wife felt partly responsible for it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That was the reason why we let him urinate in random places occasionally, even though we still scolded and yelled at him afterward.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #333399;"><i class="fas fa-star fa-lg" style="color: #ee6633"></i> </span></span>Apparently, it was not the right thing to do.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cats will be more stressed with each yelling and punishment. As a result, they will follow their instinct and behave even more inappropriately.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mayo is my living proof of that statement, because as time went by, it seemed like his condition got worse. Not only cat spraying, sometimes he even pooped in the wrong place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After purchasing the program, I went immediately to the second chapter to investigate Mayo.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The eBook explained a lot about cats’ behavior, and I could relate his behavior to most of those explanation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recently got married to the most beautiful woman I have ever met, and we decided to live together in my place. Of course, we brought Mayo with us with that decision.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The eBook explained that a new environment might lead to anxiety to cats, especially when the changes are so sudden.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The changes we brought to him was too drastic, because he never visited my place at all since birth. Not to mention that my place is bigger and more open than my wife’s ex-boarding house.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Additionally, we even bought a new litter box for him.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of those were too much for Mayo to deal with. I discovered this fact after I found in the eBook that Mayo might be suffering from feline stress, in addition to an urge to mark his new territory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He was both trying to urinate in places where my wife’s aroma lingers, which he was more familiar with, and spraying new spots in my house to leave his mark to make it more familiar to him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Luckily, I never had cat before, since I read in the book that if I had had another cat before, Mayo’s behavior would be worse.</p>

<p>After finding the cause for Mayo’s behavior, I started to find what can I do to help him stop urinating inappropriately.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried the methods stated in the book, starting from adjusting his litter box to a more comfortable place to putting things that would attract him to the litter box more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to that, I collected things he marked around the litter box, and cleaning his other traces so that he would not repeat doing it at the same place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What’s funny was the moment after I moved his litter box to a place easier for him to access. Instead of choosing going to the new spot, Mayo visited the place where it used to be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #333399;"><i class="fas fa-search fa-lg" style="color: #996633"></i> </span></span></strong></span><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>But it didn’t repeat after that, and now he ALWAYS use his litter box appropriately.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wow, I thought that the methods explained in the program was not that effective or might take more time so Mayo could adapt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, apparently simple things like moving the litter box to a new place and putting some attraction around it, like mentioned in the book, actually worked for Mayo.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #000000;">putting certain herbs around your cat's litter box will give it a good reason to use it. In addition to that, pay attention to the height and accessibility of the box.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those two points were important to make sure Mayo got used to using his litter box. And another thing I made sure of was to avoid placing it near a window so that his urinating process can be seen from other cats outside.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #333399;"><i class="fas fa-star fa-lg" style="color: #ee6633"></i> </span></span>It has been almost a month since Mayo last urinate inappropriately in my house!</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For your information, the methods are so simple and inexpensive to begin with. That’s why I can say that this program has impressed me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>All of those are done naturally!</strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really like the way all those things are explained and how effective the methods used in this program. Even better that when someday we decide to adopt another cat, I already know how to train it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to that, nothing harmful is required to do all the methods, not even yelling at your cats. Even aggressive repellents like ultrasonic or chemical spray are not used <span style="color: #008080;"><strong>AT ALL.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>First, </strong></span>each cat has different personality that can differ greatly one another. Some tame cats might give positive result like Mayo in no time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But for newly adopted cats, they might require more time and effort. Sometimes they might require you to be more creative in combining or modifying the methods explained in this program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>Second, </strong></span>this program is only available in digital format, basically an eBook. That’s okay for me since I can access it anytime from my smartphone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But some cat owners are elderly people, like my aunty, that doesn’t do good with newest technology. We have to print it manually if we want to provide them the information in this program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>Third, </strong></span>the techniques explained in this program really requires your patience and hard work. Instead of giving elderly people the program, you might want to help them physically also.</p>

<h3>Cat Spraying No More Testimonials</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Okay, so the program worked for me. But how for other people? Here are some testimonials of this program I found in internet.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff; text-decoration: underline;"><a style="color: #0000ff; text-decoration: underline;" href="#disclaimer">*</a></span></span></p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>“YOUR TECHNIQUES HAVE WORKED AMAZINGLY WELL”</strong></p>
<p><em>“I adopted Tigger from a rescue home 18 months ago. I tried everything to try to encourage him to wee in the litter tray but nothing I did worked &#8211; until a friend showed me your website! I am so grateful for the work you have put in here Sarah. Your techniques have worked amazingly well. Tigger hasn’t weed outside the little box for weeks now. Long may it continue!”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: right;">(Barbara Grayson & Tigger &#8211; Leamington Spa, UK)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>“I WAS AMAZED AT HOW QUICKLY IT WORKED!”</strong></p>
<p><em>“My mom and dad were going crazy and about to give our cat away because of her constant peeing and spraying. The house smelt horrible and they didn’t have a clue how to stop it. I love Winnie and couldn’t bear to give her up so I promised I would help. I found Sarah’s website and told my mom about it. She said if this didn’t work, that was it. She’d have to give her away. But it did! I was amazed at how quickly it worked, and how easy the methods were to put into practice. It’s now been 2 months and Winnie hasn’t gone outside the litter box at all. Thank you so much Sarah!”</em></p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>“I WOULD HAVE HAPPILY PAID HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS FOR THIS!”</strong></p>
<p><em>“Bravo Sarah! I had no idea just how simple it was to coax Arthur back to his litter box, and most of all, STOP him from peeing anywhere else in the house! It all started when we moved house 6 months ago and I’ve been at a loss as to what to do. I’ve received all sorts of ‘expert’ advice from vets, and none of it has worked. These techniques have been so easy to implement, and so cheap too! I would have happily paid hundreds of dollars for the peace of mind that this guide has given me.”</em></p>

<h3>“I Have The Same Problem”</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I realize that I am not the only one having this problem with cat behavior. This is a very common problem among cat owners, though.</p>

<p>Based on my experience with Mayo, my wife’s cat (and now our cat), we used to treat his behavior of urinating inappropriately with totally wrong method.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We had no idea about how to deal with his behavior, until we learned about it from <a href="https://buythiz.com/gocatspraynomore" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Cat Spraying No More by Sarah Richard</strong></span></span></a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The program guided us to discover the cause for Mayo’s behavior, and how to solve it naturally without harming him at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>So, will this program also work for your cat?</strong> </span>I’d say it most likely will, even though it still depends on the behavior of your cat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I based my opinion on how simple and thorough the explanations in this program is. Not only that, the range of symptoms and solution is also pretty general, making applicable for almost every cat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #07b34f;"><strong><span style="color: #008000;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #333399;"><i class="fas fa-search fa-lg" style="color: #996633"></i> </span></span></span>In addition to that, a lot of bonuses that come with the program makes it more worth it to purchase. <span style="color: #008000;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #333399;"><i class="fas fa-search fa-lg" style="color: #996633"></i></span></span></span></strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s all good, but I think there are some improvement to be made for this program. Especially for its target market that also includes elderly people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lack of physical product makes it difficult for them to access it. That’s why, printing it for them is the only way to access it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, the result can differ greatly between our Mayo and your cats, since our treatments should be different for each cat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That’s why, there is a possibility that your cat will not give as positive result as ours. In case of that, make sure to use the <span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>60 days money back guarantee.</strong></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Pencil Drawing Made Easy Honest Review</strong> &#8211; What keeps us from being good at art?</p>
<p>It could be many things but <span style="color: #333399"><strong>most of the time because we believe that not everyone can draw</strong></span>.</p>
<p>We believe that some people were born with the God-given talent to create art like Leonardo Da Vinci and some others just simply doomed.</p>
<p><span style="color: #333399"><strong>But what if it’s not true?</strong></span></p>
<p>What if we all can draw beautifully? It’s possible, right?</p>
<p>Right, but…</p>
<p>“Why my drawings are not like what I have imagined them to be?” You may ask.</p>
<p>Let me tell you the classic answer:</p>
<p>“You probably are not practicing enough.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I used to hate this answer myself but I know that at a certain point this answer completely makes sense. We’ve felt discouraged to see our bad drawings, then we gave up, and there’s no more practicing.</p>
<p>However, the practice itself can be another challenge, especially if you’re a beginner or a self-taught artist whose main resource of learning is the internet.</p>
<p><span style="color: #333399"><strong>Why?</strong></span></p>
<p>Well, with so many choices of art teaching platforms spilled over the internet, it can be overwhelming to find the right one.</p>
<p><span style="color: #333399"><strong>But let me tell you:</strong></span></p>
<p>If your jam in art is traditional realistic drawing like me, I have one reference that I personally have tried a couple of weeks ago, called:</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="color: #0000ff;text-decoration: underline"><a style="color: #0000ff;text-decoration: underline" href="https://buythiz.com/gopencildrawingeasy" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>PENCIL DRAWING MADE EASY</strong></a></span></span></h4>
<p>Along with this post, I will share with you the insight of this online art course as well as my actual experience of using it (I attach the improvement results of my drawings too).</p>
<p><span style="color: #333399"><strong>Does it bring progress?</strong></span></p>
<p>Without any further ado, let’s dive into it!</p>
<p>First stop, Let’s get to know:</p>

<h3>Who’s the Person Behind The Desk?</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pencil Drawing Made Easy is created by <span style="color: #ff6600"><strong>Nolan Clark</strong>.</span></p>

<p>The most known profile you can find about him on the internet would be:</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff6600">He is a self-taught artist and an art tutor from New Zealand</span>.</strong></p>
<p>That’s it. It pretty much has told us who he is.</p>
<p>But, if you're like me, you’d probably have this doubt and question:</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600"><strong>A self-taught artist? Can someone teach art without having a degree?</strong></span></p>
<p>This question will not be easy to address since there are always people who are for and against.</p>
<p>I personally have the doubt but not completely against the idea since I am well aware that some artists don’t have an art degree but able to work with big production houses like Disney and Pixar. Other self-taught artist ran a solo art exhibition and sold a piece worth $250k.</p>
<p>The possibility is always there, but to make sure, I’ve done research regarding this matter and like it or not, the answer is indeed <span style="color: #ff6600"><strong>yes, a self-taught artist can teach</strong></span>.</p>
<p>As we all know, art doesn’t work like medical science where formal education is required. In art, having a degree is great, but having none doesn’t mean bad.</p>
<p>However, there’s one requirement of a self-taught artist to become an art teacher/ tutor:</p>
<p>He/she must have at least professional experience in art.</p>
<p>So the question now is:</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff6600">Does Nolan Clark have the experience?</span>  </strong></p>
<p>From the record, yes, he has been doing art professionally for two decades now.</p>
<p>As written by some sources, <span style="color: #ff6600"><strong>Nolan’s art career started in 2000</strong></span>, but his interest in art grew four years earlier after “accidentally” finding out that he could actually draw.</p>
<p>Now,<span style="color: #ff6600"><strong> his works cover a wide variety of art mediums</strong></span>; pencil drawing, oil painting, acrylic, and scratchboard.</p>

<p><span style="color: #ff6600"><strong>He also created art-related books</strong></span>, one of which called; <em>“Top 25 Artist Mistakes; and How to Avoid Them”;</em> <span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="https://amzn.to/3qYHXMg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><em><span style="color: #0000ff;text-decoration: underline">Amazon</span></em></strong></a></span> shows pretty good ratings about it.</p>
<p>But it doesn’t stop there.</p>
<p>Since his first starting out, <span style="color: #ff6600"><strong>Nolan’s professional experience has always been taking a part in art teaching</strong></span>. After his self-discovery that he could draw, he became convinced that everybody else could draw too.</p>
<p>Therefore he dedicates himself to dig deep in art and shares his knowledge to teach as well as to encourage other people who take interest in art but hesitant with their own capability.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600"><strong>Now,</strong> <strong>he has taught over 3 million people through his art class</strong></span>.</p>

<li><span style="color: #339966"><strong>Lesson 1 – Introduction</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p>As it promised, the lessons included in the course are consecutive, therefore the first lesson will cover the <em>very</em> basic things before it’s gradually escalated to the next lessons.</p>
<p>Here, you’ll get introduced to the equipment; the range of pencils (from 2h to 6b), the type of erasers, and other needed equipment.</p>
<p>You’ll also get some tips on how to sharpen the pencil using the more traditional way (using the cutter), and how these sharpening techniques will help you to create different values on your drawing.</p>
<p>There will be some exercise given to get you used to the equipment. As we all know, different types of pencils create different shades of darkness. And with this kind of exercise, you’ll get the hang of each different shade of your pencils.</p>
<p>Furthermore, you’ll also learn the different types of strokes that used to create a realistic outlook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #339966"><strong>Lesson 2 – Shading Techniques</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p>Lesson 2 starts-off by previewing the first lesson; there will be more explanation of how the light would affect an object and how this light would create different shades a.k.a tonal values.</p>
<p>The most important thing you’ll get from this lesson is you’ll learn how to correctly creates transitions of contrasting tonal values. Shading is very important to create the effect of a voluminous object, especially if we’re talking about realistic drawing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Texture is another important thing you’d want to learn in mastering the art of pencil drawing. This lesson is rather challenging but it will definitely bring your drawing skill to a higher level.</p>
<p>Various objects come in different shapes and textures, and being able to capture them the way they are is important. In this lesson you’ll be taught to see things like pro artists do and able to spot the tonal values of an object correctly (in this case the given objects are onions and garlic, they are a good example of one object shares a different kind of textures).</p>
<p>To make the object looks even more convincing on your drawing (not just flying in space with no background); this lesson will also cover various ways to create a background image without losing its realistic effect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #339966"><strong>Lesson 4 – Creating Depth</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p>Lesson 4 will talk about creating an illusion of depth on a flat sheet of paper. One can say that this lesson is the extended version of lesson 2.</p>
<p>But here you’ll have a different level of difficulty. In lesson 2, it talked about the basic shading in objects in a more modest way whereas in lesson 4 you’ll get to learn how the shading creates depth to make the more complex object looks real.</p>
<p>Again, this lesson picks a suitable exercise to help us immerse with the theory. The object chosen is a rose. Rose is complex yet an apt object to learn depth; I mean, the petals are overlapping on top of each other and if we’re not correctly translating the depth, our roses will look like a mess or worse: unrecognizable.</p>
<p>The depth taught in this lesson also talks about perspective; it gives us an idea of where should the depth place if half part of the object is closer towards the viewer and the other part is further behind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #339966"><strong>Lesson 5 – Negative Drawing</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you think that drawing transparent or glassy objects is complicated and infuriating, after this particular lesson you won’t think it the same way ever again, because here you’ll learn a new technique called the negative background. And this technique will help us see the values of glassy objects better than using a positive background.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, this technique is also applicable to any other objects, including portraits. Once you get the hang of it, you can definitely improvise.</p>
<p>Plus, Don’t panic if you don’t know what negative drawing is because this lesson will explain the difference between negative and positive, and how you can combine both to manipulate a realistic outlook on your drawing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #339966"><strong>Lesson 6 – Reflective Objects</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p>Whether we realize it or not there are actually more objects around us that are reflective. And as an artist, it’s important to be able to read this reflective side of the objects even in some cases these reflective sides are very subtle.</p>
<p>You may have good shading but without this tiny part, your drawing will look like it’s missing something. The reflective side is like the final touch to make the drawing perfectly look three-dimensional.</p>
<p>Addressing this subject matter, this lesson will tell you the secrets to spot and draw the reflective side of an object correctly and not be distracted by any texture that the object has.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please also note that this course is using a <em>traditional</em> approach, which means every drawing is done by hand (and a set of pencils) <em>not digital</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff6600"><strong>You’re a beginner, a self-taught artist, or an art enthusiast in general</strong></span> who has done art for some time <em>without</em> knowing the essential art theory on realistic drawing.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you consider yourself an advance, chances are you won’t need this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff6600">You’re subscribing to the art of independent learning</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Since this course is online, there won’t be any direct interference from the tutor. Despite what this course has to offer to lift up your drawing skill, you’ll still be the one who’s in charge of your own progress.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, if you’re not sure about it, I suggest you sign up for an art school or a conventional art course instead.</p>

<h3>Do I Find This Course Beneficial? Here’s My Experience</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’ve been doing art as a hobby for so long. However, I can’t make any claim that my art is good or anything because I’m aware that in my art journey, I am guilty of skipping the basics and just dive right in. Unfortunately, the more I get deeper the more I realize that I need to go back to the surface.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600"><strong><i class="fas fa-hand-point-up fa-lg" style="color: #dd3333"></i> Doing art without knowing the basics is like building a house without a foundation. The house may look great but it will eventually crumble.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You surely don’t want that, do you? Well, I don’t, so here I am, partaking this course and so far here’s what I think:</p>
<p>Since I consider myself in a “more experienced” level; I only need to take the first four lessons (as the course suggested); and for the rest of the lessons, I can jump to whatever I like or skip it altogether.</p>
<p>I thought I wasn’t going to take any interest in joining the rest of the lessons, but when I got into it, it’s actually nice, I made up my mind and turned out spending more time on it. I mean, they have <em>Hyperrealistic drawing </em>and some other useful additional drawing skills included in their bonus section; I’d be a fool not to seize it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I’ve mentioned earlier the course given by Pencil Drawing Made Easy is an online course (with no interaction), and it can be quite challenging. Especially, since I’m not pro (duh) and therefore my eyes are not trained to critically see my art. Without the teacher’s supervision, this can be a huge struggle.</p>
<p>And as someone who has partaken the conventional art class (for cartoon drawing) before, I’d say that’s the crucial difference. With this online course, I won’t have the privilege to directly ask questions and there’s no direct supervision, nor constructive critique to get my drawing right if I make a mistake.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600"><strong>But on the other hand,</strong></span></p>
<p>I think this can be a great opportunity to force myself; to train my eyes to observe live objects; to be able to transfer them into a drawing; as well as making an objective evaluation of the result independently.</p>
<p>Moreover, the way this course serves its curriculum; the easy-to-follow instructions and theories, the useful tips, the camera angles; the printable resources, as well as the responsive customer service, I’d say it all helps the independent learning process effectively.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600"><strong>There’s more…</strong></span></p>
<p>I, later on, found out that this online course is not completely neglecting us, users. It still cares! Well, maybe not in a “direct” way but there’s still a considerate option to get feedbacks; to share progress, and get comments/ critiques by joining its <span style="color: #800080"><strong>private Facebook community</strong></span>.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of a user who received a constructive critique from the private FB community:</p>

<p>So with this all installed, can this Pencil Drawing Made Easy help my drawing skill progress?</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #800080">Yes! After some time joining this program, I indeed experienced some progress<span style="color: #ff0000"><a style="color: #ff0000" href="#disclaimer">*</a></span></span></strong></p>
<p>The progress was not just about the final result of my drawing, but most importantly is in my thinking process; how <span style="color: #800080"><strong>I can comprehend an object and differentiate its complex tones</strong></span>; like knowing where the darker shades, mid-tones, highlights, and reflected lights are placed on an object in order to create a believable drawing.</p>
<p>Here are some photos of my drawing practices:</p>

<p>The sphere drawing may look simple with not much detail but trust me it wasn’t as easy as it may seem.</p>
<p>The first circle sketch was already intimidating for me. But in the end, I’ve learned to have a good grip on my pencil and to control my hand motion so I can <em>constantly</em> be able to draw a perfect <em>big</em> round shape. Well, it’s not that perfect tho; you can still see something off on its sides, but again we’re talking about progress here.</p>
<p>Still with the sphere drawing, I’ve learned something called <em>reflected light</em>. I may have used it in my drawings before but I didn’t really know how that actually worked. Well… now I know. And this knowledge is not just applying to a sphere but also to any other object. Thanks for this course!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now let’s move on to the spoon drawing…</p>
<p><strong><i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle fa-lg" style="color: #dd3333"></i> <span style="color: #ff0000">This is where I feel kinda irritated with the course</span></strong>. I’m shocked that it teaches users to trace an image. I’ve attended an art class before, and this tracing method is a big no-no. Because first, it’s cheating, second, it doesn’t train you to organically study the object’s structure.</p>
<p>However, Nolan indeed has sensible reasoning behind this tracing practice. He argued that for starters, this method is a considerate solution to focus on the study of the tonal values a.k.a shading, and not bother too much with drawing the outlines.</p>
<p>So, in this case, I give him that. As long as tracing is used as a part of the learning process, it’s fine; but if it’s used to create a final art piece, that’s intolerable!</p>
<p>Okay, everything is cool now, let’s go back to the spoon drawing…</p>
<p>The spoon’s outlines were already served on the printable resources. So all I gotta do is just paying attention to its shades and practice the shading.</p>
<p>It certainly required me more time to grasp how light falls into a metal object and to deconstruct its tonal values. But <strong><span style="color: #800080">this course has done a pretty good job on the lesson’s delivery; the follow-along video has a fair explanation</span></strong>. As a result, I think I’ve made the shading looks pretty decent!</p>

<p>I actually have every progress with every lesson I’ve taken noted down, but I think I’ve given you enough insight into the main lessons.</p>
<p>So, to save time, I’m gonna wrap my testimonial up with a bit of my experience on my favorite <em>bonus </em>lesson; Hyperrealistic drawing.</p>
<p>The Hyperrealistic drawing lesson was seriously addressing my shortcoming when it comes to drawing a portrait: the skin textures. I used to play it safe by mostly draw a young female’s face. It’s surely easier to draw but my drawings went monotonous.</p>
<p>That’s why I’m glad that this course has one session dedicated to teaching how to draw hyper-realistic skin (specifically on wrinkly older man’s skin). It also provides tips to selectively choose and edit a good reference photo.</p>
<p>Hence to really test out the given tips as well as the step by step skin drawing instruction, I decided to find the reference photo myself (instead of using the already given one). After that, I will juxtapose it with my old related drawing, just so we can make a clear judgment about it.</p>
<p>Here’s a drawing I made before:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you can see, It looks stiff, scratchy, the shadow is all over the place, the eyes look dull, and it doesn’t have much of skin detail.</p>
<p>And here’s a <em>WIP</em> (<em>work-in-progress)</em> I made after joining the lesson:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="11096" data-permalink="https://buythiz.com/review/pencil-drawing-made-easy-review-nolan-clark/attachment/wip" data-orig-file="https://buythiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/wip.jpeg" data-orig-size="1080,996" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="wip" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://buythiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/wip-300x277.jpeg" data-large-file="https://buythiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/wip-1024x944.jpeg" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11096" src="https://buythiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/wip-1024x944.jpeg" alt="" width="559" height="515" srcset="https://buythiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/wip-1024x944.jpeg 1024w, https://buythiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/wip-300x277.jpeg 300w, https://buythiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/wip-768x708.jpeg 768w, https://buythiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/wip-1536x1417.jpeg 1536w, https://buythiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/wip-2048x1889.jpeg 2048w, https://buythiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/wip-163x150.jpeg 163w, https://buythiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/wip-100x92.jpeg 100w, https://buythiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/wip-380x350.jpeg 380w, https://buythiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/wip-788x726.jpeg 788w, https://buythiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/wip.jpeg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 559px) 100vw, 559px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To be fair, this <em>WIP</em> is not drawn merely based on the hyper-realistic lesson, <strong>it actually a summation of the lessons I’ve taken so far</strong> (Shading Technique, Creating Depth, Realistic Eyes and Nose, and lastly the Hyperrealistic drawing for the skin detail).</p>
<p>Not so much of a hyper-realistic drawing<em>, </em>I know…</p>
<p>But, what do you think?</p>
<p>Did I make good progress?</p>
<p>Are you interested to make progress of your own?</p>
<p>In case you are…</p>

If the seeds you sowed were good seeds, happiness is coming soon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But if the seeds you sowed were bad, you should also be prepared to find annoying things start to get in your way. Well, after I turned 30, I realized that it is true.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All the knowledge and experience I gained before 30 started to light up my pathways in life. And all my recklessness also started to take its tolls on me.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My body condition in my early 30s that includes changes in fitness and performance start to show some differences compared to a couple years ago.</p>

<p>I was too surprised that entering my 30s would make me realize so many things. In some cases, I am doing better than anyone at my age I know, but in some other cases I feel weaker than everybody.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will tell you about some of my health problems later, and how surprisingly <a href="https://buythiz.com/gonaturalsynergy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Natural Synergy Solution by Emily J.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, a program called Natural Synergy Solution is the reason why I want to share my experience in this review. The reason is because I want everybody to know that such program exists.</p>

<h3>How Do We Treat Pain?</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our body is so complex and complicated. Even researchers and medical experts still cannot 100% explain every single detail about it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, we all naturally able to recognize if something is wrong with our body. Most of the time it comes as unpleasant feeling or pain.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><span style="color: #008000;"><span style="color: #333399;"><i class="fas fa-heart fa-lg" style="color: #d3d155"></i> </span></span>That’s why, the first question a medical expert asks us is about the existence of unpleasant feeling or pain in our body.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But why do those feelings is important? Furthermore, why do we even need the ability to detect unpleasant feeling or pain in our body?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact, those unpleasant feelings and pain we feel in our body is actually the signal given by our nervous system to tell us that something is wrong with some part of our body.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Without the ability, we will not be able to detect anything wrong, and that’s not a good thing. Imagine not being able to prevent infection of a wound located at the back of your head.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those unpleasant feelings and pain are important for such case. And even though nobody likes the feeling, we really need it.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #333399;"><i class="fas fa-check fa-lg" style="color: #ee1234"></i> </span></span>What comes after pain is the treatment done to ease it or cure it. This is the most important process.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many of us use painkiller to solve this problem. However, we all know that consumption of painkiller doesn’t solve anything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>First</strong></span>, painkiller only reduce the pain, not eliminate it from the source. Such kind of pain will come back again later after the effect wears out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>Second</strong></span>, it can grow into a bad habit that may lead into addiction. An addiction to painkiller is real, and it is the last thing we ever want.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>Moreover</strong></span>, painkiller is ineffectively expensive! Thus, rather than keep consuming painkiller, why don’t we try to strike directly to the health problem that becomes the source of pain?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><span style="color: #000000;">Natural Synergy Solution by Emily J. Park is</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #008064; text-decoration: underline;"> a guide for us </span></strong></span><span style="color: #008064;"><span style="color: #000000;">to ease any of our health problems naturally without the use of any dangerous substances and expensive therapies.</span></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is my first impression after purchasing and practicing the program, and I already find that this is very helpful. That’s why I want to share my experience with this program to you.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I told you before, after 30 came, things started to change for me. Yes, beautiful things did happen or is happening, but on the other hand the ‘bad seed’ I sowed are also beginning to grow, especially in my fitness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fitness and health conditions such as waking up tired, joint pain, addiction to nicotine, and lack of stamina happen more often nowadays, compared to two or three years ago.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><span style="color: #008000;"><span style="color: #333399;"><i class="fas fa-heart fa-lg" style="color: #d3d155"></i> </span></span>I’m still young enough, am I not? Then why do all those things start happening to me?</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I reminisced what ‘bad seeds’ that I have sowed and I found there are several of it. I am a chain smoker, I injured myself in a parkour session, I was too lazy to do workouts after graduating from college, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The effects of those things used to be contained in my young body, but now, it all has been released back to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I looked for the solutions, but most of them suggested me to consume some medication, supplements, or any other chemical-based things.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I didn’t despise the idea, but based on my consideration, it would cost me so much money to get back my fitness and health like when I was young.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to that, the solutions they offer only solve the problem one by one. One for my joint pain, one for my smoking habit, one for my stamina, etc.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The imbalance between those two usually results in health problems. Pinning specific acupoints in our body, where either of the Qi flow is blocked, will help us distribute the energy evenly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Acupuncture uses special needles to pin some points in our body called acupuncture points or acupoints. But for some people, this method is not preferred because inserting needles to our body is too scary.</p>

<div id="attachment_10628" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10628" data-attachment-id="10628" data-permalink="https://buythiz.com/review/natural-synergy-solution-by-emily-j-park/attachment/acupuncture-practice" data-orig-file="https://buythiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/acupuncture-practice.jpg" data-orig-size="773,500" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="acupuncture practice" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://buythiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/acupuncture-practice-300x194.jpg" data-large-file="https://buythiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/acupuncture-practice-1024x662.jpg" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-10628" src="https://buythiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/acupuncture-practice.jpg" alt="acupuncture practice Natural Synergy" width="500" height="323" srcset="https://buythiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/acupuncture-practice.jpg 773w, https://buythiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/acupuncture-practice-300x194.jpg 300w, https://buythiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/acupuncture-practice-1024x662.jpg 1024w, https://buythiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/acupuncture-practice-767x496.jpg 767w, https://buythiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/acupuncture-practice-1536x994.jpg 1536w, https://buythiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/acupuncture-practice-2048x1325.jpg 2048w, https://buythiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/acupuncture-practice-232x150.jpg 232w, https://buythiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/acupuncture-practice-100x65.jpg 100w, https://buythiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/acupuncture-practice-541x350.jpg 541w, https://buythiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/acupuncture-practice-788x509.jpg 788w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><p id="caption-attachment-10628" class="wp-caption-text">Acupuncture</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then come another technique that doesn’t require inserting needles called acupressure. Basically, the philosophy between the two is the same: pinning the right spot to bring back the balance of our body’s energy.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;"><span style="color: #008000;"><span style="color: #333399;"><i class="fas fa-anchor fa-lg" style="color: #33d322"></i> </span></span></span>The program explains a lot of those spots and how to do the process by your own. And it doesn’t require so much time, actually it requires only 1 to 2 minutes per spot.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The locations of the spots are also depicted in clear pictures so we can know exactly the acupoints to press.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, the way the program guides us to the right spots to press is so simple. It uses an approach based on what do you feel or want to fix in your body.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In example, I choose the addiction spot for my smoking habit, insomnia spot for better sleep, knee and lower back pain spot for my injury, also for fitness and stamina.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #008000;"><span style="color: #333399;"><i class="fas fa-coffee fa-lg" style="color: #d33333"></i> </span>Every condition usually has 4-9 spots we can choose to press.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> Every day, for the last 10 days since I joined the program, I press the spots mentioned and averagely it takes me only about 20 minutes. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Such a convenience for me because I don’t have to go out of my room to do it, and I can choose any time of a day to do it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But pressing the acupoints is not the only way this program helps us to fix our body. We are literally talking about a method to make energy constantly flow better here.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong><span style="color: #008000;"><span style="color: #333399;"><i class="fas fa-align-right fa-lg" style="color: #eeee33"></i> </span></span>Additionally, the program includes the miracle of sounds and frequencies to do the job. </strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">This is the difference I noticed between Natural Synergy Solution by Emily J. Park and other programs. </span>There is another method called Electro-acupuncture which uses electric needles to ‘pressure’ the spots, and this one is said to be the more effective method.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, since this program doesn’t include needles, Natural Synergy Solution uses the alternative method called <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff6600; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Acu-Frequency.</strong></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This Acu-Frequency, just like its name, <span style="color: #09b355;"><strong>utilizes frequency</strong></span> that we can get from sounds with a technique called entrainment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Entrainment happens when a dominant vibrating frequency causes another to vibrate in harmony with it. This phenomenon is<span style="color: #09b355;"><strong> an actual science and the basis for sound therapy.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An example of entrainment is when you strike a tuning fork, and it vibrates, try to get it closer to another tuning fork and you will discover that the other one is also vibrating.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #800080;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #008000;"><span style="color: #333399;"><i class="fas fa-caret-right fa-lg" style="color: #dd3333"></i>  </span></span></span></span>Using this logic, we can also use such law of nature to give our acupoints or Qi spots the same energy as electricity without being stabbed with electric needles.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This program exposes us to many frequencies that will resonate with our body and boost the ailments for conditions we are having.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of those things can be done anywhere anytime, with only about 3-5 minutes needed for each condition you want to solve.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I said before, because I choose to fix 4 things which are my smoking habit, sleep, pains from my injury, and fitness I spent averagely only 20 minutes to do it all for the last 10 days.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The program is a digital one that you can access from your computer, tablet, or smartphone easily. Just login or keep logged in, and open it via web.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>In addition to that, the program even provides you an application for your smartphone to make accessing it far simpler.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The smartphone version of it is just 66 megabytes, but it already contains every single thing you need starting from the acupoints, ailments, music, sounds, preset beats, and also frequencies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or if you like it offline, you can also just download the eBook version of the program where you can get information of the Qi spots or acupoints, but without the sounds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #008000;"><i class="fas fa-align-left fa-lg" style="color: #dd3364"></i> Basically, it provides you three choices of access: offline access, application access, and web access.</span> </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each of them has its own pros and cons. Here is a list of their pros and cons:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>Web Access:</strong></span> Full access to everything, requires constant connection to internet</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>Smartphone Application:</strong></span> Direct access to contents, fewer explanations</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>eBook:</strong></span> Full explanations, offline access, doesn’t include sounds (download separately)</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see there, the choice is yours. For me, I use all of the three because it is far suitable than just having one access to a program in my opinion</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, about the contents, I will show you from the most complete version of it which is the web version. Here you can see that the program is divided into 8 main parts and the introduction sections.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p></a></span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What’s being explained in each part is as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #038571;"><strong>Introduction</strong></span>: Just like any other program, the introduction tells you about the origin of the program and how to read the instructions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #038571;"><strong>Part 1 – TCM:</strong></span> Not only it explains Traditional Chinese Medicine is preferred at this age, but also what benefits we can get, contraindications, how to do the acupressure, and the after-treatment care.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #038571;"><strong>Part 2 – Medicinal Science of Sound:</strong></span> This is the part that explains how sounds can affect our health in both good and bad way.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #038571;"><strong>Part 3 – Ailments:</strong></span> In this part, you will be shown a list of diseases and conditions that the program can help you cure. This part is connected to Part 4 where the acupoints are located.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #038571;"><strong>Part 4 – Acupoints:</strong> </span>This is where you can find the list of over 400 acupoints for acupressure. This part is connected to Part 3 to make it easier to find the right acupoint based on your condition.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #038571;"><strong>Part 5 – Frequencies</strong>:</span> Since Acu-frequency uses both acupressure and the power of sound to heal our bodies, this is the part where you will find the sounds and frequencies to be used in this program.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #038571;"><strong>Part 6 – FAQ:</strong> </span>Of course, you might have some questions about this program, and here should be the first part you visit if you have any.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #038571;"><strong>Part 7 &#8211; Glossary:</strong></span> Some vocabularies used in this book might be unusual for you, but you can find the right term and meaning here.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #038571;"><strong>Part 8 – Conclusion:</strong></span> What’s more to explain? This is literally just a conclusion of the program.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;">From my own opinion,<span style="color: #803300;"><strong> the most important parts are from Part 3 to Part 5</strong></span>. The rest of it is just an explanation that you can read or skip as you want.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, this program gives pretty good explanations about everything, not too wordy nor confusing. You might want to read the explanations to understand more about the methods used, if you are not in an emergency.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The method Acu-Frequency she used has wide range of usage. Knowing that it can benefit a lot of people, she decided to share her experience and information in this program.</p>

<p><strong> </strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p>You have acne problem? Access the program, click on the ailments section, find the keyword “acne”, and viola you are directed to the page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have other problems? Or do you want to just focus on some acupoint or sound? Just do the same thing. Accessing the contents is that easy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And I have mentioned twice above, I choose 4 problems to fix: smoking habit, sleeping improvement, knee and lower back pain, and stamina.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From all of those conditions, I chose 3 spots which are most suitable with my condition, and gave pressure to it for about 1-2 minutes each for the last 10 days.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>In some parts, I feel a tingly pain while I stimulate it, especially in a spot connected to my knee pain called Xi Yan. But the program says that’s normal.</strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While pressing it, I made sure to play the sounds and frequencies related to the acupoints (if any) to get greater result, and I think it worked out pretty well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>To compare it with the result, I should tell you my problems.</strong> </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a habit to smoke about 6 cigarettes a day, for the last 2-3 months. It was even I did some kind of self-therapy to help me quit smoking with a program called <a href="https://buythiz.com/review/mindzoom-dino-ruales-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mindzoom</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also used to feel a sting in my lower back and knee when standing up from sitting too long or when I lift too much weight. I suppose that was the result of my injury while I was doing parkour.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the 10<sup>th</sup> day, I started to collect hints of any changes I feel in my body, and for the result my knee & lower back pain still can be felt while lifting weight, but not while moving in normal way.</p>

<p><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>In addition to that, my smoking appetite was reduced to only 3 cigarettes a day.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those two are the most significant changes I felt in my body after using this program. While for my sleeping and fitness problem, I still couldn’t find how to measure it.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #333399;"><i class="fas fa-search fa-lg" style="color: #996633"></i> </span></span>Overall, I think purchasing this program is indeed beneficial for me.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not only because it showed <span style="color: #000080;"><strong>significant result in two of my four problems</strong> </span>mentioned above in just 10 days, but also because the <span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>contents are hands down so complete</strong>!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My sister has acne problem, and this program provide the solution for that. My mother has lower back pain, and I can suggest the solutions from this program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not only it will help you, but you can use it to help people you love too because there are <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>more than 150 health problems</strong> </span>that this book covers!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I personally feel satisfied with the program. The <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>$47 price tag</strong> </span>that this program offered me, along with <span style="color: #000080;"><strong>60 days money back guarantee</strong></span>, is worth the purchase in my opinion.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>There are just some small things I think that this program is lacking.</strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First is about the eBook. It doesn’t include the sounds that the online version provides, but it has the “play sound” button. Or at least in my version of <a href="https://get2.adobe.com/reader/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adobe Reader</a>, I cannot click on the play sound button.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the program itself offers separate download for offline use which <span style="color: #003300;"><strong>provides 14 audios for accompanying the pdf. </strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second, the desktop app of this program is actually available. However, to get it we should pay <span style="color: #800080;"><strong>additional $15</strong>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Knowing that the web version of it already provides complete information, I think it is a matter of choice whether we want to access the desktop app or not. But paying additional $15 is not worth it in my opinion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact, this program also offers three other additional purchase that doesn’t interest me that much, so I didn’t choose to get it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The three other additional purchase are joining VIP Club, Total Life Mastery program <span style="color: #993300;"><strong>($77)</strong>,</span> and Inner Game of Wealth <span style="color: #993300;"><strong>($17)</strong></span>. Of course, each has its own benefit, but I didn’t come here to get those things.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong><span style="color: #069137;"><span style="color: #000080;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #333399;"><i class="fas fa-share fa-lg" style="color: #8112e2"></i> </span></span></span></span><span style="color: #09b355;">Apart from those things, the initial purchase of Natural Synergy Solution by Emily J. Park satisfies me with all the contents and especially the results.</span></strong></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Okay, so I myself think that this program is a good offer. But will it also be useful for you? The program itself explains that acupressure is not for everyone, and some might need to avoid acupressure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is a list of conditions where you should avoid acupressure, based on the program:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>had surgery</strong> </span>recently — it is advisable to wait for acute inflammation to resolve. Do not perform acupressure over the surgery area.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have recently <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>suffered a heart attack or stroke.</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have been <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>diagnosed with cancer.</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Burns, wounds, and skin infections</strong> </span>— acupressure is contraindicated over wounded, or infected skin.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Varicose veins</span> </strong>— pressure over varicose veins can cause severe pain and worsen the problem.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Bone fractures</span> </strong>— do not apply acupressure directly on a fracture spot. Slight pressure on the perimeter can be useful to increase blood flow and promote healing.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>If you notice an <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">undiagnosed lump or mass</span> </strong>— speak to a physician first to find out what the mass is.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Pregnancy</strong> </span>— special precaution, there’s a series of points that should not be used in pregnancy for they may put the pregnancy at risk or induce labor.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Acupressure should be avoided when there is any <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>instability in the spine</strong></span>, compressed vertebrae or a fractured spine.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Acupressure in the <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>groin, neck, under the armpits and below the ears</strong> </span>should be avoided when suffering from lymphoma. In general, these points should be gently stimulated and can be sensitive when a person is detoxifying.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Patients suffering from <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">haemophilia</span> </strong>and other blood clotting disorders need to consult their health care practitioner before acupressure is administered.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to that, since <a href="https://buythiz.com/gonaturalsynergy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Natural Synergy Solution by Emily J. Park</strong></span></span></a> includes the power of sound to boost healing, it may include some frequencies that your ear cannot accept.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some people might feel <span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>nausea while listening to some frequencies or beats</strong></span> for elongated time, and in this case the program suggest to stop it and only apply the acupressure technique.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, the program covers <span style="color: #000080;"><strong>more than 150 most health problems</strong></span>, but we know that there are <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>millions other health problems</strong> </span>on earth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There’s a probability that your very specific condition is not covered by the program, and in this case, I suggest you to claim the <span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>60 days money back guarantee</strong></span> if you don’t find it beneficial for you.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If from my explanation above you consider that this program might also benefit you, or you want to try whether or not it will work for your problem, you can purchase it here.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #09b355; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Simply follow the link provided below.</strong></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://buythiz.com/gonaturalsynergy" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" style="border-radius:5px" class="wpsm-button gold big"><i class="rhicon rhi-check-circle"></i> FOLLOW THIS LINK TO PURCHASE </a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The cost of initial purchase is <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>one-time charge $47</strong></span>, which means you will not be asked to pay additional money in the future for <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff; text-decoration: underline;"><strong><a href="https://buythiz.com/gonaturalsynergy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Natural Synergy Solution by Emily J. Park</a>.</strong></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, as I mentioned above, there are some optional purchases you can make once you already join the program such as Desktop app, VIP Club, Total Life Mastery program <span style="color: #993366;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>($77)</strong></span>,</span> and Inner Game of Wealth <span style="color: #993366;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>($17)</strong></span>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Afterall, this program is covered by <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>60 days money back guarantee</strong> </span>that you can claim any time in that time span. So, I think there is no risk of losing your money from trying it out and doesn’t feel satisfied.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still, if you think that $47 is too much money for just a program to cure your health condition, you should know that this program offers <span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong>so many bonuses at once.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What? Bonuses?</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, this program is so generous in giving bonuses. Not only one or two, but in total you can get <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>4 additional items for free</strong></span>.</p>

<h3>Natural Synergy Solution Verdict And Conclusion</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on my 10 days experience with this program, I found that it has helped me in two of four problems I needed to solve. The other two might need more time or more exact measurement.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>So, will I recommend this program for you?</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on the practicality of this program that covers more than 150 health problems, I think this program might be suitable for many people. Not only it is a self-treatment program, but also it doesn’t require much time to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, this program is not an instant fix, but rather a long-term solution for your health problems because it utilizes a technique that rather than giving a quick but weak snap, it aims to solve the problems with steady build up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The price is quite comprehensible because of so many features that it includes with initial purchase of <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>$47</strong></span>. It also comes with <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>60 days money back guarantee.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are some additional purchases that you can get for extra contents, but I personally didn’t opt to get it because I considered the initial purchase alone was enough.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Natural Synergy Solution is a program that utilizes acu-frequency technique to fix your energy or Qi flow in your body to cure more than 150 disease and conditions mentioned in the program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This program offers 60 days money back guarantee to ensure consumers’ satisfaction, since customers’ satisfaction may vary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The initial purchase will give you access to webbook, eBook, and smartphone application. Each has its own pros and cons like I mentioned above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It might require some time before the conditions can go away completely, but the time required actually depends on many factors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are some people who need to read the contraindications I mentioned above first before practicing this program such as pregnant women, patients with heart attack, open wounds, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You might also feel tingling pain while doing the methods, but that’s normal because it includes pressuring your body parts in specific locations.</p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Before I begin, let me just say that I work out routinely at home, about 5 days per week. </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">I don’t skip leg days and I specifically train my glutes occasionally, with glute activation exercises beforehand.</span><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Sorry if I came across like I was trying to brag; that's not my intention at all. </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">What I’m saying is,</span><span data-contrast="auto"><span style="color: #43b3ae;"><strong> I didn't see my booty growing with all that</strong></span></span><span data-contrast="auto">. </span></p>

<h3 aria-level="2"><span data-contrast="none">Weak vs strong glutes</span><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">When one has weak glutes, they usually have some problems with their lower bodies or lower backs. </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">S</span><span data-contrast="auto">hould they try to work out using free glute activation exercises videos on the internet, they either <span class="wpsm-highlight wpsm-highlight-yellow">undertrain these muscles or train only one or two muscles</span>.</span><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Our buttocks have three muscles: <i class="fas fa-dice-three fa-lg" style="color: #0f52ba"></i> </span><span data-contrast="auto"><strong>gluteus maximus (</strong></span><strong>Gmax), medius (Gmed), and minimus (Gmin<span data-contrast="auto">)</span></strong><span data-contrast="auto">. </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">According to Brian Klepacki, the author of this program/book, </span><span data-contrast="auto">Gmax</span><span data-contrast="auto"> is the one responsible for balance when we walk and run. </span><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">It can produce high levels of force at low speeds through small ranges. </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">At the same time, it has the ability to produce low levels of force at high speeds through large ranges of motion.</span><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Gluteus </span><span data-contrast="auto">medius</span><span data-contrast="auto"> and </span><span data-contrast="auto">minimus</span><span data-contrast="auto"> play an important role in </span><span data-contrast="auto"><span style="color: #43b3ae;">pelvic stabilization</span></span><span data-contrast="auto">. The difference is that the former is smaller in size, with slightly different function.</span><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">If any or all glute muscles are not strong enough, our bodies will compensate and recruit other joints like the lumbar spine. </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">It’s nice how our bodies can adapt, </span><span data-contrast="auto"><span style="color: #a81c07;"><strong>but this can lead to injury of these joints</strong></span></span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">This program is dedicated to people who want to get visible results within a short period of time. </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">And according to Brian Klepacki, that is possible. He's very confident about it that </span><span style="color: #ff6700;" data-contrast="auto"><strong>he offers money back guarantee in 60 days, no questions asked</strong></span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p>

<h2 aria-level="1"><span data-contrast="none">What’s inside Unlock Your Glutes? </span><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Basically, Unlock Your Glutes gives you a book in pdf form and 4 video guides (or workout videos). </span></p>
<p><i class="fas fa- stopwatch fa-lg" style="color: #0f52ba"></i> Each video (for the glutes) has different lengths, from 15 to 20 minutes.</p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The book itself includes 13 chapters with references about glute activation exercises that you can look up on the internet.</span><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">I'm just going to simplify things.</span><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Chapter 1 until 6 are basically information explaining what are glutes, the in-depth anatomy breakdown, and reasons why we all need strong glutes. </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Then, chapter 7 until 9 talk about how to </span><span style="color: #ff6700;" data-contrast="auto"><strong>make our buttocks bigger and stronger with the right exercises, because squats are not one of them</strong></span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Moving on to chapter 10 to 12, they’re all about the program. Coach Brian Klepacki talks about how diet and nutrition play important roles in making our glutes dream come true. </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In addition, he gives workout routines: </span><span data-contrast="auto"><strong>bodyweight (BW) only, gym only, and combination.</strong></span><strong> </strong></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Last chapter, 13, is just pictures and steps to doing each movement or exercise. After that, there’s author page, notes (in case we want to print the pdf and write some notes), and references.</span><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Even though it may sound wordy and you don’t really like reading, I highly suggest you read through everything. </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Once we’ve read Unlock Your Glutes and decided which routine we want to do, then it’s time to pay attention to the videos. </span><span data-contrast="auto">There are 4: BW A and B, Gym C and D.</span></p>
<p>For BW workouts, the only equipment you may need is a mat. And as for gym exercises, you're going to need weights <i class="fas fa-dumbbell fa-lg" style="color: #0f52ba"></i> (barbells, dumbbells, machines) <em>and</em> a mat.</p>
<p>But don't worry if you don't have a dedicated home gym or whatsoever, we can still do these glute exercises at home. More on that later.</p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">We can do the workout along, as if we’ve got our own personal trainer that keeps motivating us, which is nice. </span><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Each video is well-structured and different from the others. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #a81c07;">If we don’t know the purpose of every phase and exercise, we may skip some movements and that won’t bode well for us</span>.</p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">That’s why I recommend reading the manual first before jumping straight to the videos.</span><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Yeah, you won’t get only a book and 4 videos. This program also gives you </span><span data-contrast="auto"><span style="color: #43b3ae;"><strong>two additional leg workouts</strong></span></span><span data-contrast="auto"> in video format, </span><span data-contrast="auto"><span style="color: #43b3ae;"><strong>an educational video</strong></span></span><span data-contrast="auto"> (like a lecture about glutes), and </span><span data-contrast="auto"><span style="color: #43b3ae;"><strong>14-day fat loss diet book</strong></span></span><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Simply put, you're </span><span data-contrast="auto">gonna</span><span data-contrast="auto"> get quite a lot with this program. </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">That's nice, because we don’t need to compile everything by ourselves and we can focus on dieting, booty strengthening and enlarging, as well as toning our legs meanwhile.</span><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p>

<h2 aria-level="1"><span data-contrast="none">FAQ</span><span data-ccp-props="{"> (from website)</span></h2>
<h5><span data-contrast="auto">Why should I buy this over other glute programs?</span><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></h5>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Look, it's this simple. No other program hits all THREE gluteal muscles with all THREE exercise strategies in all THREE planes of motion to FORCE your glutes to grow. Your choice is clear. A program based on real-life in-the-field experience and the latest science. Or a program stuck in the past based on decades-old research that leaves you weaker, less powerful and worse &#8211; with a butt you're embarrassed about.</span><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p>
<h5><span data-contrast="auto">How long does it take to complete the full program? Will I see results in that time?</span><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></h5>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Unlock Your Glutes is a four-week program with two days of glute exercises per week. This length of time is optimal for strengthening and changing the shape of your butt. You can keep repeating the program for as long as you want. In fact, when you see the results you will most likely make this your weekly routine.</span><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p>
<h5><span data-contrast="auto">How hard are the exercises to perform?</span><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></h5>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Not hard at all. There are a lot of exercises &#8211; 36 in total &#8211; but I've selected these based how easy they are to follow. You know the only program you'll stick to is one you can follow. That's why you have the handbook and all the videos demonstrating perfect form.</span><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Like I mentioned above, you’re getting a workout program for glutes with this. </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">So,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> what you need to do once you’ve purchased this package is prepare yourself and do the program. </span><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The coach has put together a variety of best glute exercises that definitely targets our rear end. </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">He explains each phase of the workouts well. For example, restorative lengthening session maximizes the effectiveness of the whole routine, and the burn phase ensures the toning of our backside.</span><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">He also includes <i class="fas fa-dumbbell fa-lg" style="color: #0f52ba"></i> </span><span data-contrast="auto"><strong>Finisher workouts</strong></span><span data-contrast="auto"> that we can choose. They're done at the end of the workout specifically designed to kick our butts.</span><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In Unlock Your Glutes manual, the coach tells us how important diet is for shaping and strengthening our rumps. </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Well, his 14-day fat loss bonus book is there to help us, so everything comes together. </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">You just need to read the books and do the workouts to make this program work.</span><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Now, in Unlock Your Glutes, the coach says we should do this two times per week for a month. But he welcomes the idea of doing it regularly. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #43b3ae;"><em>I figured I should try doing the workouts 4 times per week for two weeks and see if I could still see results. </em></span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Let me show you my journal first. By the way, </span><span data-contrast="auto"><span style="color: #43b3ae;"><strong>I did the combination routine</strong></span></span><span data-contrast="auto"> (BW and gym). </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">As I said, even though the coach says it’s gym routine, we can still do all those glute exercises at home.</span><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 aria-level="2"><span data-contrast="none">1</span><span data-contrast="none">st</span><span data-contrast="none"> glutes day &#8211; BW A</span><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></h4>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">I realized that Coach Brian Klepacki doesn’t explain about proper form in his videos, which is why </span><span style="color: #ff6700;" data-contrast="auto"><strong>reading the manual is crucial</strong></span><span data-contrast="auto">. </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">He emphasizes on pausing and control (time under tension), and I was surprised I couldn’t do some movements well.</span><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Now, if you’re a total beginner and you don’t know how to engage your glutes or proper form, </span><span style="color: #ff6700;" data-contrast="auto"><strong>I suggest you learn about them first</strong></span><span data-contrast="auto">. </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">I mean, </span><span data-contrast="auto"><span style="color: #43b3ae;">I know about those and still ended up engaging my hamstrings</span></span><span data-contrast="auto"> during the glute activation exercises.</span><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">This day I only did one set for each phase, because I wasn’t quite confident yet.</span><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Pretty sore. I tried to do the set two times each phase. </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">It was alright, but I found out I have muscular i</span><span data-contrast="auto">mbalance</span><span data-contrast="auto">s on my glutes and was pretty bummed out about it. </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Decided that I’d do my next routines twice.</span><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 aria-level="2"><span data-contrast="none">3rd glutes day &#8211; Gym C</span><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></h4>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Had come to realize that </span><span data-contrast="auto"><span style="color: #43b3ae;">this program is most suitable for intermediate to advanced people</span></span><span data-contrast="auto">. </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">I'm neither; I simply have experience, and yet I had to modify the side plank exercise. </span><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">During that exercise, I was putting too much tension on my shoulder and neck until I got a light headache (that’s when you stop). </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff6700;"><strong>For total beginners who don’t know how to modify, this could be problematic. </strong></span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Also, on some movements like hip thrusts, the coach keeps on saying push further up. </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Yes, we should do that, but only when we know exactly which muscles to engage. </span><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">When I was a newbie, I did hip thrusts and bridges while engaging my lower back. </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">That could get me higher, but it led me to lower back pain <i class="fas fa-frown-open fa-lg" style="color: #ffd800"></i>. </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">So yeah, if you’re a total beginner, <span class="wpsm-highlight wpsm-highlight-yellow">learning about mind-muscle/body connection and proper form first is important</span></span><span data-contrast="auto"><em>.</em></span><em> </em></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Did it, but I modified another type of side plank hold. I’d done an arm/shoulder workout before and I couldn’t hold my position for a long time, plus my neck was straining, so did the modified version.</span><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">For me, </span><span data-contrast="auto"><span style="color: #43b3ae;">it’s more important that I know my glutes were working</span></span><span data-contrast="auto"> instead of copying what the demonstration lady is doing. </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Honestly, when I tried to do the side plank, I was feeling my arms, abs, neck, and shoulders instead of glutes.</span><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Maybe it’s because I still didn’t have the body strength, or my glutes were too weak to do this particular movement. </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Nonetheless, </span><span data-contrast="auto"><span style="color: #43b3ae;"><strong>at this moment I knew that this is NOT for total beginners</strong></span></span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Starting this week, I decided that I wanted to do the Finisher routine because I had become more confident. </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">This time, I did the </span><span data-contrast="auto">tabata</span><span data-contrast="auto"> and I almost gave up on the fourth set, but I didn’t. Metal music helped a lot</span><span data-ccp-props="{"> <i class="fas fa-grin-beam fa-lg" style="color: #ffd800"></i>.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Admittedly, I also modified the side plank this time because I'd done a weighted HIIT before. Even so, my glutes were feeling it. </span><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">When I did a deadlift exercise, I noticed that I was feeling my calves and the arch of my feet engaging. </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">I don’t know why that happened. </span><span data-contrast="auto"><span style="color: #43b3ae;">Just know that if you do this later and feel the same, know that you’re not alone</span></span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Because it </span><span data-contrast="auto">kinda</span><span data-contrast="auto"> hurt me, I didn’t do the 3-1-2-0 tempo like Coach Brian Klepacki.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">One thing I noticed straight away when I read this book (I like to skip through first) is that there’s no references. </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Coach Brian Klepacki makes a lot of claims here, but I could find no proof to back them up.</span><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In the Unlock Your Glutes program, the coach said that we should restrict or reduce carbs (for fat loss or muscle growth, respectively). </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">For sure, that’s fine.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">A simple search on google scholar can lead us to many studies that suggest carbs are fine, particularly for people who are not sedentary. </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Just like what the coach says in Unlock Your Glutes, you can eat carbs to grow muscles; the complex kind, that is. </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Coach Brian says we can only eat brown rice.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Aside of the diet itself, I was surprised when Coach Brian Klepacki bans coffee in the fat loss book (and again, not stating the reason). The only source of caffeine allowed is green tea.</span><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #43b3ae;" data-contrast="auto">While I realize that this tea has a lot of benefits, so does coffee. </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">I mean, each has its own advantages. There are lots of studies about coffee and green tea benefits for weight loss, exercise, and overall health (all in moderation, of course). </span><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Speaking of green tea, the coach also says that we should get the organic, high-quality one. </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">According to him, the opposite of those qualities contains dangerous levels of fluoride.</span><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">A </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319422597_Fluoride_concentrations_in_traditional_and_herbal_teas_Health_risk_assessment" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2017 research</a></span><span data-contrast="auto"> suggests that all kinds of green tea is fine, in moderate amount. </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Additionally, </span><span data-contrast="auto"><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/301834481_Journal_of_food_science" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff; text-decoration: underline;">a research from 2016</span></span></a></span><span data-contrast="auto"> says that preventing fluorosis from tea is under investigation, but </span><span data-contrast="auto"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff; text-decoration: underline;"><a style="color: #0000ff; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://buythiz.com/review/red-tea-detox-liz-swann-miller" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tea</a></span></span></span><span data-contrast="auto"> consumption itself doesn’t result in the intake of </span><span data-contrast="auto">of</span><span data-contrast="auto"> excessive amounts of fluoride for most adults.</span><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Moreover, </span><span data-contrast="auto"><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/330400611_Comparison_of_Fluoride_Ion_Concentration_in_Black_Green_and_White_Tea" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0000ff;">this 2018 research</span></a></span> <span data-contrast="auto">says that there’s a lot of factors contributing to the amount of fluoride release in tea. </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Choosing the organic, high-quality kind may affect it. However, brewing time, water temperature, and water hardness can have an impact on fluoride release as well.</span><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Yeah, I can’t quite comprehend this one. </span><span data-contrast="auto"><span style="color: #43b3ae;">I'd say if you’re more of a green tea person, then you should stick to this caffeine and vice versa.</span></span><span style="color: #000000;" data-ccp-props="{"> <i class="fas fa-coffee fa-lg" style="color: #8b4513"></i></span></p>

<h4>One thing to remember</h4>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Though, <i class="fas fa-hand-pointer fa-lg" style="color: #43b3ae"></i> </span><span data-contrast="auto"><strong>the thing about diet and fitness is that everything narrows down to your own experience and needs</strong></span><span data-contrast="auto">. </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">There are countless of studies and research you can find, proving we should do this or that. That's why you shouldn’t be afraid of doing trials and errors with your own body and see which is the best for you.</span><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Yeah, in short, I didn’t do the fat loss program. </span><span data-contrast="auto">Firstly, it’s complicated to do in my family. Secondly, I'm quite skeptical about some claims. </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Thirdly, </span><span data-contrast="auto"><span style="color: #43b3ae;"><strong>I wanted to know if I could still get results by doing “bad” diet/choices.</strong></span></span><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">His leg workout videos look great, and I like the fact that the coach included them in Unlock Your Glutes package. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #43b3ae;" data-contrast="auto">But to be honest, I prefer leg day videos from a YouTube channel I know and like. </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Over the course of my glutes growing weeks, I skipped leg days. Instead, I did HIIT to replace the missing workouts for my lower body. </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">I worried that I'd be too fatigued if I did leg days, so I didn’t.</span><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">I do think </span><span data-contrast="auto"><span style="color: #43b3ae;">his BW leg workout video is great for you who’s just started your fitness journey</span></span><span data-contrast="auto">. It doesn’t look hard and is easy to follow. </span><span style="color: #ff6700;"><strong>Do it at your own </strong><strong>pace</strong><strong> if you’re a newbie</strong>. </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Don't get me wrong. Even though until now I haven’t done his leg </span><span data-contrast="auto">routine</span><span data-contrast="auto">, I'd definitely do it when I need a variety.</span><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Result?</h2>
<p>So, in two weeks, with four glute activation exercises each week and without the right diet, this program still brought me result.</p>
<p><span style="color: #43b3ae;"><strong>I managed to grow my booty 0.5 cm</strong></span>.</p>
<p>I said earlier that my starting glute circumference was 89cm, <span style="color: #000000;"><strong>it grew to 89.5 cm! </strong></span><i class="fas fa-surprise fa-lg" style="color: #ffd800"></i></p>
<p>Not much of a difference, I know, but I feel that my backside has become even firmer.</p>
<p>It's quite embarrassing to put before after pictures because you can't see my glutes growing evidently, so I don't.</p>
<p><span style="color: #43b3ae;"><span style="color: #000000;">Nevertheless,</span></span><span style="color: #43b3ae;"><strong> my buttocks have improved, no lies</strong></span><span style="color: #43b3ae;"><strong>.</strong></span></p>
<p>Long story short, <i class="fas fa-thumbs-up fa-lg" style="color: #0f52ba"></i> <strong>Unlock Your Glutes works</strong>. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><a style="color: #ff0000;" href="#disclaimer">*</a></span></p>
<p>For faster, more evident results, you should combine it with proper diet.</p>
<p>Doesn't have to be the coach's fat loss program, but I still think that nutrition plays an important role for muscle building.</p>

<h3 aria-level="2"><span data-contrast="none">What I like</span><span data-ccp-props="{"> from Unlock Your Glutes</span></h3>
<ul>
<li><span data-contrast="auto">The fact that </span><span data-contrast="auto"><span style="color: #43b3ae;">we can do glute exercises at home</span></span><span data-contrast="auto">. As I said, even though the program says gym routine, we can still do it in our own abodes.<br />
&nbsp<br />
</span>It's also pretty simple and easy to follow.<br />
&nbsp</li>
<li>You don’t feel like you're struggling alone when doing these glute activation exercises.<br />
&nbsp<br />
At times, you can see the lady demonstrator trying her best to do a workout and it’s nice to see that human reaction coming from a fit person.<br />
&nbsp</li>
<li>In the Unlock Your Glutes manual, we get <span style="color: #43b3ae;">an extensive info about glutes</span>.<br />
&nbsp<br />
Some parts can take a bit of time to digest, but it's because there’s not enough graphics to show which is which (for example, where Gmed is).<br />
&nbsp<br />
The language itself is great, I could understand what the coach is saying well.<br />
&nbsp</li>
<li>It felt like I have my own personal trainer. When I follow a video from YouTube, the trainer is also doing the movement.<br />
&nbsp<br />
So, they can’t keep reminding me to keep squeezing my glutes or something like that, and it’s something different that I noticed.<br />
&nbsp</li>
<li><strong>Result</strong>.<span data-ccp-props="{"> The program worked on me even though I didn't go on a diet like what Coach Brian Klepacki says. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><a style="color: #ff0000;" href="#disclaimer">*</a></span></span></li>

<h3 aria-level="2">My criticism</h3>
<ul>
<li><span data-contrast="auto"><span data-contrast="auto">All routines from Unlock Your Glutes don’t have cool-down stretches. The coach doesn’t include it in the book or videos.<br />
&nbsp<br />
</span></span>He doesn’t explain why, maybe we don’t need them at all.<br />
&nbsp<br />
But since I combine his program with other workouts, and maybe you do this too, I need to cool down.<br />
&nbsp</li>
<li>Something I don’t particularly enjoy doing is any movement with the 3-1-2-0 tempo.<br />
&nbsp<br />
Sometimes it’s too slow that I ended up engaging some other muscles instead (not the core), and I don’t know if it’s a good thing or not. It hurt aka it made me moderately uncomfortable.<br />
&nbsp</li>
<li>There's <span style="color: #43b3ae;">no videos or pictures about the Finisher movements</span> and, like I said, I had to look them up online first.<br />
&nbsp<br />
Not a big thing, but considering that the coach has put together many things in this package, I do think he should’ve included this one.<br />
&nbsp</li>
<li>Maybe it’s just me, but I feel like we can get free information and free glute exercises at home by researching and scheduling.<br />
&nbsp<br />
I realize that it can be hard to decide which information is credible or not. We also may not have the time for that, so I'm not discounting Coach Brian Klepacki at all.<br />
&nbsp<br />
It’s just that if we have the will, we can do it alone.<br />
&nbsp</li>
<li>No citations or references in the diet book like I mentioned. <span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></li>

<ul>
<li>I'm going to say this again because I think it’s important.<br />
&nbsp<br />
<span style="color: #ff6700;"><strong>Total beginners should know about mind-muscle connection, breathing during workout, and how to engage the right muscles.</strong></span><br />
&nbsp<br />
Muscle strain isn’t fun.<br />
&nbsp</li>
<li>If you plan to do the gym routine too, buy a thick mat, two sets of dumbbells (lighter pair and heavier pair) but the more the merrier, and a set of resistance bands.<br />
&nbsp<br />
You can buy a gym bench but it’s not necessary since you can do some exercises from your sofa.<br />
&nbsp<br />
By thick mat I mean 6mm minimum, and you’ll need this one too if you’re doing the BW routine.<br />
&nbsp<br />
I'm quite bony around my lower body, and whenever I did exercise holds on my belly, <span style="color: #43b3ae;">my crotch hurt</span>. Folded towel didn’t help.<br />
&nbsp</li>
<li>You should do the glute exercises at home on their own.<br />
&nbsp<br />
I mean, you can totally mix it with other workouts, but you may get exhausted quickly.<br />
&nbsp<br />
<span style="color: #43b3ae;"><strong>If you’re at advanced level, heck, you can do whatever you want!</strong></span></li>

<ul>
<li>Find cool down exercises. Some of us can be just fine without cool down altogether, while some of us need them.<br />
&nbsp<br />
I'm in the latter group. And if you're like me, go online and find your preferred methods of cooling down (active or passive).<br />
&nbsp<br />
Many people believe that active post-workout session is better, but <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40279-018-0916-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this 2018 review</a></span> says that it's not always the case.<br />
&nbsp<br />
Additionally, the research says that stretches negatively affect runners while I personally like stretches.<br />
&nbsp<br />
However, I'm no runner/athlete, and you do you!<br />
&nbsp</li>
<li>Should you feel a stress around your neck, traps, and shoulders, <span style="color: #ff6700;"><strong>just stop and find modifications</strong>.</span><br />
&nbsp<br />
You don’t want to force yourself all the time or else you’re going to <span style="color: #43b3ae;">live with bulging veins on your temples</span>.<br />
&nbsp<br />
Mine are the result of frequent tension when I did core exercises wrong back then.<br />
&nbsp</li>
<li>For you total beginners, be mindful about that. And remember,<span style="color: #ff6700;"> <strong>do the glute activation exercises at your own pace</strong></span>, if you’re like me.<br />
&nbsp</li>
<li>Again, if you’re not sedentary and you’re active, you don’t need to do the diet program.<br />
&nbsp<br />
Should you think you can do it, and that kind of diet is already your lifestyle, feel free to do Coach Brian Klepacki’s diet book.</li>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Quoting from Coach Brian Klepacki himself, “This program is suitable for anyone, male or female, who wants to develop a stronger, rounder butt. I designed it for every level, from the gym rat to the newbie who has never set foot in a gym before,”</span><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">“You see, unless you're an athlete &#8211; a sprinter &#8211; chances are your glutes are weak. Everyone will improve their glute strength and stability with this program.”</span><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">But from me, a person who’s tried Unlock Your Glutes, <i class="fas fa-hand-pointer fa-lg" style="color: #43b3ae"></i> </span><span data-contrast="auto"><strong>I can tell you that this program may not be for everyone</strong></span><span data-contrast="auto">. </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">You've got to have at least some basics because if you don’t, </span><span data-contrast="auto"><span style="color: #a81c07;">it may lead to injury</span></span><span data-contrast="auto">. I can understand why that one bad review exists.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In my opinion, this program is sort of like a crash course. </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Let's say you’ve got an upcoming event like a party or beach holiday and you want to look so good and </span><span data-contrast="auto"><span style="color: #000000;">lean </span></span><span data-contrast="auto">within 2 weeks or a month. Well, this program is your best friend.</span><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">People who are in intermediate or advanced fitness level should find the best glute exercises in this program. </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">If you’re one of them, you’ll definitely grow more strength and size in your glutes.</span><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p>

<h2 aria-level="1"><span data-contrast="none">Where to Buy Unlock Your Glutes?</span><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">You can get Unlock Your Glutes from a lot of place, really. But for safety reasons and bonus, I do recommend buying from its own website for </span><span style="color: #ff6700;" data-contrast="auto"><strong>$15</strong></span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span></p>
<p>Mhm, you saw that right. This program only costs you $15, which is a total steal.</p>
<p>Four videos of highly-effective glute activation exercises, a thorough book about glutes, 2 leg workout videos, and a fat-loss diet book. All delivered to you in an instant with a cheap price.</p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">All in all, I think Unlock Your Glutes is </span><span data-contrast="auto"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>worth a try</strong></span></span><span data-contrast="auto">. </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The workouts are fun to do despite my own limitations, and it still brought me results. Plus, I learned more about glutes and my own booty. </span><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Looking forward, I’ll continue doing the coach’s glute activation exercises. But I'll combine them with my other choice of workouts so that I'll have variety.</span><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Admittedly, I found that some of Coach Brian Klepacki’s claims on nutrition and diet are sort of weak, </span><span data-contrast="auto"><span style="color: #43b3ae;"><em>but it was just my skepticism talking</em></span></span><span data-contrast="auto">. </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Think you should try it? Then do it! <i class="fas fa-smile-wink fa-lg" style="color: #ffd800"></i></span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Besides, if I’m ever in need of a program that will shed some fat in a short time, I may do his fat-loss program!</span><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto"><span style="color: #43b3ae;"><strong>TLDR, I'm happy with Unlock Your Glutes, and I think you should try it</strong></span></span><span data-contrast="auto">. </span></p>
<p><a name="Disclaimer"></a></p>
<p>Good luck with your glute-enhancing journey!<span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto"><i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle" style="color: #a40000"></i> You should always consult your doctor or physician before doing these workouts.

<p>Results may vary depending on your body types, fitness level, lifestyle, and diet.</p>
<p>Last but not least, pay attention to your food allergies or intolerance before trying the coach's diet program. Would be better if you talk to a professional nutritionist.</p>
